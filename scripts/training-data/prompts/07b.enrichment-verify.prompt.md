You are Stage 07b of a production data pipeline.
Your task is to verify Stage 07 enrichment quality and produce one strict JSON object.

Critical requirements:
- Return JSON only. No markdown. No code fences.
- Use only the supplied input package.
- If evidence is insufficient, mark uncertainty explicitly instead of inventing support.
- Keep issue/check codes stable and machine-readable.

Output contract:
- Top-level fields to produce:
  - `status`: `PASS` | `WARN` | `FAIL`
  - `gate_decision`: `pass` | `review` | `block`
  - `reason_code`: short machine reason (snake_case style)
  - `checks`: array of check rows
  - `issues`: array of canonical issue rows
  - `metrics`: object with counts and ratios when available
  - `waivers_applied`: array (empty if none)
- A check row should include:
  - `severity`: `error` | `warning` | `info`
  - `check`: check code
  - `message`: concise explanation
  - `signal_class` (when known)
  - `remediation_path` (when known)
- An issue row should include:
  - `issue_code`
  - `issue_severity`: `critical` | `major` | `minor` | `info`
  - `gate_decision`: `pass` | `review` | `block`
  - `signal_class`
  - `remediation_path`
  - `message`
  - `conversation_id` (or null)
  - `segment_id` (or null)
  - `evidence_segment_ids` (array)
  - `confidence` (0..1 when possible)

Evaluation goals:
1. Evidence alignment:
- Flag claims that are not supported by provided evidence segments.
- Prefer `issue_code=evidence_alignment_mismatch`.
- Do not flag this when evidence is partial-but-plausible and non-contradictory; use `info` check text instead.

2. Hallucination control:
- Flag concepts/techniques asserted without transcript support.
- Prefer `issue_code=hallucinated_concept_claim`.
- Use this only for clear unsupported assertions, not for missing exact keyword matches.

3. Phase coherence:
- Detect impossible or contradictory sequencing in enrichment phase narratives.
- Prefer `issue_code=phase_coherence_violation`.

4. Unsafe repair overreach:
- If repair implications look semantically overreaching relative to supplied context, flag it.
- Prefer `issue_code=unsafe_repair_overreach`.

5. Support density:
- If high-impact claims have thin support coverage, flag review-level risk.
- Prefer `issue_code=low_support_density`.
- For low-impact talking-head/testimonial summaries, low support density alone should not force `review`.

Severity and gate guidance:
- Use `block` for clear, material integrity failures (major/critical).
- Use `review` for meaningful but non-fatal risk.
- Use `pass` when quality risk is low and evidence is adequate.
- `pass` is correct when all detected problems are minor/info and none represent material factual contradiction.
- Never emit duplicate issues for the same root problem; keep only the strongest issue row.
- Do not set warning severity by default. Use `warning` only when there is concrete, actionable risk.
- Keep output internally consistent:
  - if all issue rows are `gate_decision=pass`, overall `gate_decision` must be `pass`.
  - if overall `gate_decision=pass`, `status` must be `PASS` and checks should be `info` (not `warning`) unless a concrete actionable risk remains.
  - avoid duplicate issue rows with same `issue_code` + same scope.
- `hook_rate_zero` alone is not a review reason for talking-head/testimonial or noisy infield transcripts; keep it informational unless it causes material evidence contradiction.

Signal/remediation guidance:
- artifact-level contract/input problems:
  - `signal_class=artifact_contract`
  - `remediation_path=contract_repair`
- transcript quality/evidence ambiguity:
  - `signal_class=transcript_quality`
  - `remediation_path=transcript_review`
- coherence/content quality risks:
  - `signal_class=other_quality`
  - `remediation_path=manual_review`

Input package:
{{INPUT_JSON}}

Now return one JSON object only.
