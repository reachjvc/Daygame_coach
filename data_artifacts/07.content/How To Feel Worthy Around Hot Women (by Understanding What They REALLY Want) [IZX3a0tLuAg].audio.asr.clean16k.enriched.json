    "reasoning": "Good speaker attribution (coach at 0.97 confidence). Coherent overall narrative about worthiness and attraction. Issues: multiple run-on segments lacking punctuation (15-18, 33-35, 41-46), some awkward segment boundary breaks mid-sentence, informal speech patterns ('uh', 'you know') reduce clarity. No artifacts flagged. Usable but would benefit from punctuation cleanup."
