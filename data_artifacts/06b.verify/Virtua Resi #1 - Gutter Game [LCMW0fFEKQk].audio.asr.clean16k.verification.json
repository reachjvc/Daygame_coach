  "summary": "This is a well-classified podcast episode. SPEAKER_00 correctly identified as coach delivers an extended instructional monologue on gutter game theory, eye-dating strategies, and escalation techniques. SPEAKER_01 and SPEAKER_02 are appropriately labeled as 'other' serving as co-hosts who ask questions and make brief supplementary comments. All 433 segments being marked as commentary (conversation_id=0) is correct since there are no actual daygame approaches in this video - it's purely theoretical discussion. The classification pipeline handled this podcast format accurately.",
