  "summary": "The video shows a single continuous group interaction ('7 Minute Pull') incorrectly classified as 'compilation' when it should be 'infield'. Role assignments are generally correct with SPEAKER_03 as the main coach and SPEAKER_04/05 as targets in a group. However, segments 111-122 show signs of transcription/diarization errors where multiple speakers' dialogue appears merged, making those specific attributions unreliable. The collapsed speaker overrides are appropriate. The main actionable issue is the video type misclassification; the role confusion in the middle section appears to be upstream transcription quality issues rather than classification errors.",
