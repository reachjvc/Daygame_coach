  "summary": "This is a correctly classified podcast featuring two daygame coaches discussing technique evolution, night game vs day game, and skill development analogies. All 161 segments are appropriately labeled as commentary since there are no live approaches or target interactions. The role assignments (SPEAKER_02 as primary coach, SPEAKER_01 as secondary coach) are accurate based on speaking patterns and content. One minor issue: SPEAKER_00 (segment 128) appears to be a diarization artifact where SPEAKER_02's speech was briefly misattributed, but the 'other' classification is harmless. Duplicate segments at the beginning and end suggest minor transcription artifacts but don't affect downstream processing.",
