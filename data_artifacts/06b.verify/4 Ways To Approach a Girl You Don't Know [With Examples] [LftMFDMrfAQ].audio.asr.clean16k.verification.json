    "Video type 'podcast' at 82% confidence is questionable — 'talking_head' would be more accurate given the 95.6% single-speaker dominance. Downstream processing expecting podcast-style multi-speaker dialogue will find almost none.",
    "SPEAKER_01 segments [201-202] ('Okay.' / 'So those') at 758.6-758.9s are extremely short (0.2s and 0.1s) and may be diarization artifacts rather than genuine speech from a second speaker.",
    "SPEAKER_02 segment [124] ('So I don't recommend doing that one.') at 467.6-469.4s sounds like it could be the coach (SPEAKER_00) continuing his thought rather than a distinct other speaker — minor diarization concern."
  ],
  "summary": "Role assignments and conversation boundaries are correct — this is entirely instructional commentary with no live approaches, which is accurately reflected by having all segments as conversation_id=0. The primary issue is the video type classification: 'podcast' is inaccurate for what is essentially a single-speaker instructional video (talking_head) with minimal co-host interjections. SPEAKER_01 and SPEAKER_02's contributions are too sparse (10/225 segments) to constitute a podcast. Additionally, a few very short SPEAKER_01 segments and one SPEAKER_02 segment may be diarization artifacts. Recommend reclassifying video type to 'talking_head' before downstream processing.",
