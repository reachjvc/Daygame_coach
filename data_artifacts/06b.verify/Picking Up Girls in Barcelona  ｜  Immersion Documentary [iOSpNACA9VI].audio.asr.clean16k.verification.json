Main issues: seg 399 misattributed coach escalation as target, SPEAKER_04 segs 515-517 are student testimonial mislabeled as coach, Conv 4 is a 1s fragment not a real conversation, Conv 7 should be commentary. SPEAKER_06 has several segments incorrectly overridden as coach that are student banter. The output needs fixes but is structurally sound.",
