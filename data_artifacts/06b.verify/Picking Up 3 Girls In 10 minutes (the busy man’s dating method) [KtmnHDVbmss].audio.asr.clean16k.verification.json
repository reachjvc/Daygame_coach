  "summary": "The classification is largely correct - video type, conversation boundaries, and coach identification are accurate. However, there are two notable issues: (1) A transcription error at segment 11 where the target's name was incorrectly transcribed as 'James' (the coach's name), and (2) SPEAKER_01 bleeds across multiple conversations when it should be distinct targets, particularly segments 120-121 in Conv 2 and several segments in Conv 3. These are diarization artifacts where the system couldn't reliably distinguish between different female voices. The collapse override system correctly identified SPEAKER_00 as the coach, but the target speaker separation needs review. Flagging rather than rejecting because the core structure (3 approaches + commentary) and coach identification are correct - the issues are with target speaker disambiguation.",
