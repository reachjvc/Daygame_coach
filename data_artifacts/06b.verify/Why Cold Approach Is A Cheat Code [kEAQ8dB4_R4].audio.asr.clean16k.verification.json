  "summary": "This talking_head video is correctly classified. Todd (SPEAKER_00) delivers a continuous 13+ minute monologue about cold approach philosophy without any live approaches or interactions. All 248 segments from SPEAKER_00 are correctly labeled as coach commentary. The only minor anomaly is segment 248 from UNKNOWN, which appears to be song lyrics from outro music captured in transcription after a 20-second gap - this doesn't affect the core classification but could be filtered as non-speech content.",
