The main issues are: (1) Seg 490 in Conv 7 where the coach's self-introduction 'I'm James' is misattributed to the target — this is a clear error; (2) Conv 1 is a teaser/cold-open duplicating Conv 2 content, which will cause double-counting; (3) Segs 270-272 in Conv 3 appear to be coach wrap-up speech misattributed to the target; (4) Seg 160 likely captures a target response misattributed to coach. None of these individually corrupt the dataset catastrophically, but seg 490 is a definite misattribution and the Conv 1 duplication should be addressed before downstream processing. Flagging for review rather than rejecting because the core structure and majority of assignments are sound.",
