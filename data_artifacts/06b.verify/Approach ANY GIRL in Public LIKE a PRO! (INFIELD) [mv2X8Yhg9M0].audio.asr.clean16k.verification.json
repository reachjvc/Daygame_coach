  "summary": "This is a single extended daygame approach correctly identified as a compilation due to voiceover structure. The main issue is SPEAKER_00 and some SPEAKER_01 segments where diarization failed to properly separate speakers during rapid exchanges. Segments [1-2] are clearly the coach's opener but assigned to 'other'. Several coach-override segments on SPEAKER_01 contain blended dialogue from both speakers. The core role assignments (SPEAKER_03=coach, SPEAKER_02=voiceover) are correct, and the conversation boundary is appropriate. Flagging for review of the misattributed opener segments and blended dialogue segments, but overall structure is sound.",
