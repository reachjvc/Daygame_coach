Most likely cause: diarization incorrectly split one woman's voice into two speaker IDs (SPEAKER_02 appears only 6 times vs SPEAKER_01's 23 times). All SPEAKER_02 segments should likely be collapsed to SPEAKER_01, OR if truly different people, SPEAKER_02 should be reclassified as 'other'. Current output will break downstream processing expecting one target per conversation.",
