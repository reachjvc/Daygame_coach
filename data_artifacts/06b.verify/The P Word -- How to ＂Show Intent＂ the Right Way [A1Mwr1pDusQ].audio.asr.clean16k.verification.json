  "summary": "This is a correctly classified talking_head video. A dating coach delivers a 20-minute educational monologue explaining the concept of 'premise' as an alternative to 'showing intent' in pickup/dating contexts. All 388 segments are appropriately marked as commentary with no conversations, since there are no actual approaches or target interactions in this video. The single SPEAKER_01 segment (50) and UNKNOWN segment (387) are minor diarization artifacts that don't affect the classification - one is part of a hypothetical scenario the coach is voicing, the other is an automated outro after a long pause. No corrections needed.",
