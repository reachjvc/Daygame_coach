These cannot be fixed by role reassignment alone — they need re-segmentation at the audio level.",

    "Segments 0-2 appear to be pre-approach conversation between coach and wingman/cameraman ('you need to get socially lubricated', 'like a small one?', 'yeah') before the approach begins at seg 3-5. Could be reclassified as commentary or a separate pre-approach segment."

Segment 108 ('I'm sober') is misattributed to coach when it's the target answering 'are you wasted?'. Segment 50 ('Tell us') is likely coach, not target. Critical: segments 111-125 have severe diarization failures with both speakers in single segments — needs audio-level re-segmentation, not patchable via role fixes alone.",
