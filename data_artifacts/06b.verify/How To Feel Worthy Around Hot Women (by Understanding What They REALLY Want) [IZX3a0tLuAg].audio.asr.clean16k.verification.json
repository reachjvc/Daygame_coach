  "summary": "This is a correctly classified talking_head video featuring a dating coach giving instructional content about self-worth and attraction. SPEAKER_01 (coach) dominates with 156 segments of teaching material, referencing 15+ years of experience and promoting coaching services. SPEAKER_00 and SPEAKER_02 are correctly labeled as 'other' - they are workshop participants who briefly contribute thoughts when the coach asks questions (segments 54-58, 68-70). All segments are appropriately marked as commentary (conversation_id=0) since there are no actual daygame approaches in this video. No errors detected.",
