  "summary": "Primary issue: segments 0-15 are cold-open teaser containing actual dialogue but mislabeled as 'approach commentary'. Three UNKNOWN segments (5, 12, 134, 140-141) should likely be 'target'. One possible role error at segment 82 (SPEAKER_03 saying 'Really?' may be coach, not target, but low confidence). Speaker collapse system is correctly handling SPEAKER_01 and SPEAKER_03 appearing as different people across conversations. Overall structure is coherent - 6 approaches with commentary, 3 successful number closes."
