#to test if scripts are working. AI must ALWAYS do this when running a script.

#1
Create LOGS at /docs/logs/ that go through any tests that fail.

#2
When AI has changed a script, it must ALWAYS try to run the script. 

#3
If the script fails, AI must ALWAYS add a new step to its plan to fix the script.

#4
AI must always then complete that step.

#5
A training-data script must ALWAYS have usage commands in the form:

# Use:
#   A) One source (video / playlist / channel):
#      ./scripts/training-data/02.transcribe "daily_evolution" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utuuVOXJunM"
#
#   B) Batch from sources file:
#      ./scripts/training-data/02.transcribe --sources
#      ./scripts/training-data/02.transcribe --sources docs/sources.txt

#6
If in doubt on what file to run for a script step, choose "daily_evolution" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utuuVOXJunM"
