# Day Reporting: Life Field Reports

**Status:** Brainstorm
**Updated:** 31-01-2026

## Changelog
- 31-01-2026 - Initial creation from conversation about applying field report methodology to daily life

---

**[AI did not think to suggest specific questions, for example about being a better runner or coder, which is what I had thought of, but of course, AI didn't know that becoming a better coder was really important for me today too, need to think of this]**

## Original Prompt

> Let's say I want to understand how to improve my day. I ran a half marathon and worked for many hours and ate food etc. What would be my "field report" for life of today? Start by giving me the logic for your answer, and then the questions you would ask me to answer.

## The Logic: Why A "Life Field Report" Works

### Core Insight from the Research

The research shows that effective learning comes from the same pattern across all domains - military operations, sports, poker, BJJ, sales, aviation:

**Experience → Reflection → Insight → Action**

This is Kolb's learning cycle. Most people do step 1 (live the day) and skip 2-4. That's why years of experience don't automatically create expertise.

### Why Your Day Is Like A "Session"

Your day (half marathon + work + eating) has the same structure as any performance session:

| Session Element | Your Day Equivalent |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Pre-session intention | Did you have goals for today? |
| Execution | The 15+ hours of doing things |
| Energy/state management | How you paced across domains |
| Key moments | Decisions, transitions, high/low points |
| Outcomes | What you accomplished |
| Gap between intent & actual | The interesting learning zone |

### The Critical Distinction: Decision Quality ≠ Outcome Quality

From poker/trading research: **You can make excellent decisions that lead to bad outcomes, and terrible decisions that luck into good outcomes.**

For your day:
- Deciding to run a half marathon might have been a great decision even if you're exhausted now
- Eating junk food at lunch might have felt good but was a poor decision
- The question isn't "did things go well?" but "did I make good choices given what I knew?"

### The Multi-Domain Complexity

Unlike a focused skill session, a day has **competing domains**:
- Physical (running, eating, sleep, energy)
- Work (tasks, focus, output)
- Mental/Emotional (stress, mood, fulfillment)
- Social (interactions, relationships)
- Growth (learning, progress toward longer goals)

**Energy is zero-sum.** The half marathon depleted physical resources. That affects cognitive work. The research calls this "physiological state" - it's one of Bandura's four sources of self-efficacy.

### The "Why Did It End?" Question

The daygame research found this is THE critical learning question. For your day, the equivalent is:

**"Where did your energy/focus/productivity drop off, and why?"**

The answer is almost never "I just got tired." It's usually:
- Depletion from earlier (the marathon)
- Decision fatigue
- Missing recovery moment
- Poor nutrition timing
- Emotional drag from something

### The Lead-Up Matters

From BJJ research: Focus on what happened BEFORE the key moment.

If you crashed at 3pm, what happened between 12-3pm? That's where the learning is.

## Questions For Your Day

### Pre-Day (Retrospective)

1. **Did you set any intentions for today before it started?** (Even implicit ones like "I'm going to run this race and then work")

2. **How did you feel when you woke up?** (Energy, mood, anticipation - this is your baseline)

### The Half Marathon

3. **What was your goal for the run?** (Time target? Just finish? Enjoy it?)

4. **How did actual vs. intended go?** (Hit your goal? Faster/slower? Unexpected challenges?)

5. **How did you feel immediately after finishing?** (Energized? Depleted? Proud? Relieved?)

### Energy & Recovery Management

6. **What did you do in the 2 hours after the race?** (This is the "lead-up" to your work session)

7. **What and when did you eat today?** (Timing matters as much as content)

8. **Did you have any planned recovery or was it straight into work?**

### Work Session

9. **When did you start working and what did you intend to accomplish?**

10. **What actually happened with your work?** (Output vs. intention)

11. **If your focus or energy dropped, at what point and what preceded it?**

### The Gap Analysis

12. **What's the biggest gap between what you intended and what happened today?**

13. **Looking at that gap - was it a decision problem, an energy problem, or an expectations problem?**

### Internal State Tracking

14. **Rate these for today (1-5): Energy, Mood, Focus, Satisfaction with decisions made**

15. **What emotion dominated your day?** (And when did it shift?)

### The "What Would You Tell A Friend?"

16. **If a friend did exactly what you did today (half marathon + work), what would you say to them?** (This unlocks self-compassion)

### Forward Action

17. **What's one thing you would do differently if you replayed today?**

18. **What's one thing that went well that you want to repeat?**

## Missing Question Categories (For Future Iterations)

The initial questions were domain-agnostic. Future versions should include **skill-specific questions** based on user goals:

### Running-Specific
- What aspect of running technique did you focus on today?
- Did you notice anything about your form, breathing, or pacing?
- What would make you a better runner next time?

### Coding/Work-Specific
- What technical skill did you practice or improve today?
- Did you learn something new about the codebase/technology?
- What coding decision are you most/least satisfied with?
- If you could refactor one thing you wrote today, what would it be?

### General Skill Development
- Which of your long-term goals did today contribute to?
- What skill did you deliberately practice (vs. just do)?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test this framework for 1 week
- [ ] Add domain-specific question modules
- [ ] Determine optimal question count (18 may be too many for daily use)
- [ ] Create Quick Log version (3-5 questions max)
