# Progress Tracking Ideas - Brainstorm
**Status:** Research/Brainstorm
**Updated:** 29-01-2026 07:46 (Danish time)

## Core Philosophy
The goal is to help users actually improve at daygame, not gamify for engagement's sake. Progress tracking should serve reflection, accountability, and skill development.

**Key Principle: Customization is King**
Users should be able to create a tracking flow they genuinely enjoy. Every template should have static core elements plus dynamic/customizable elements. When tracking feels personal, it stops being a chore.

---

## 1. Commitments & Goals

### Weekly Commitments
- User sets a commitment each week (e.g., "I will do 10 approaches this week")
- Simple yes/no tracking: Did you fulfill your commitment?
- Streak tracking for consecutive weeks of fulfilled commitments
- Option to set "stretch goals" vs "minimum acceptable"

### Skill-Focused Goals
- "This week I'm focusing on: [opening / eye contact / assumption stacking / etc.]"
- Tie field reports back to whether they practiced the focus skill
- Monthly skill themes the user can opt into

### Challenge Mode
- Pre-defined challenges: "Approach 3 women in the next hour"
- User-created challenges they commit to publicly
- Time-boxed challenges (30-day approach challenge, etc.)

---

## 2. Field Reports

### Template Philosophy: Static + Dynamic
Each template has:
- **Static boxes**: Core questions that define the template type (always present)
- **Dynamic boxes**: User-customizable questions they can:
  - Add from a question library
  - Write their own custom questions
  - Remove questions they don't find useful
  - Reorder to match their thinking flow

This makes each user's field report truly their own over time.

### Template Options

**Quick Log - "The Speedrun" (30 seconds)**
Static:
- Date/time/location
- Number of approaches
- Overall energy (1-5)

Dynamic (choose 1-2):
- Best moment
- One thing to improve
- Highlight interaction
- Vibe of the day

**Standard Report - "The Debrief" (2-3 minutes)**
Static:
- Context (where, when, solo/with wing)
- Approach breakdown (opened with X, she responded Y, ended because Z)
- Key takeaway

Dynamic (choose 2-4):
- What went well
- What to work on
- Emotional state
- Technique attempted
- Would you do it differently?

**Deep Dive Report - "The Forensics" (5-10 minutes)**
Static:
- Full interaction transcript/reconstruction
- Connection to current skill focus

Dynamic (choose 3-6):
- Emotional state analysis (before, during, after)
- Body language self-assessment
- Voice/tonality reflection
- Specific technique attempts and results
- What she was communicating (reading signals)
- Environmental factors
- Inner dialogue during the interaction

**Blow-Out Analysis - "The Phoenix"**
> Note: This could exist as its own template OR as an optional add-on module in the Q&A Coach. Consider offering both paths.

- Specifically for harsh rejections
- What happened (factual)
- How did it feel (emotional)
- Reframe/learning (growth)
- "Would I do it again?" (building resilience)
- What would you tell a friend who experienced this?

### Report Enhancements
- Voice-to-text option for field reports (record while walking home) - see Voice Tech section
- Photo attachment for location memory
- Tag system: #opener #numberclose #instantdate #blowout #wing
- Link reports to specific approaches within a session

---

## 3. Live Session Tracker (PRIORITY FEATURE)

> Daygame guys LOVE data and tracking. This should be best-in-class.

### Core Counter
- Large, thumb-friendly tap button for each approach
- Running total prominently displayed
- Session timer (how long you've been out)
- "Time since last approach" counter (accountability nudge)

### Quick Logging Per Approach

- Optional voice note (transcribed later)

### Live Stats Dashboard

- "You're 2 approaches ahead of your usual pace!"

### Session Goals

## 4. Periodic Reviews

### Design: Template Cards
When user goes to do a review, they see 3 cards to choose from:
- Each card has a fun name + brief description
- User picks the one that fits their mood/time
- They can customize any template over time (static + dynamic boxes)

**Important: These reviews should be useful for LIFE, not just daygame.** Frame questions broadly enough that insights apply to career, fitness, relationships, personal growth.

### Weekly Review Templates

**"The Quick Win" (5 min)**
- 3 wins this week (any area of life)
- 1 lesson learned
- Next week's single focus
- Commitment: Yes/No fulfilled?

**"The Operator" (10 min)**
- What went well? (life + game)
- What patterns am I noticing?
- What would I tell last-week-me?
- Numbers snapshot (optional)
- Next week's commitment

**"The Deep Thinker" (15-20 min)**
- Wins across all life areas
- Lessons & insights
- Patterns in behavior/results
- Emotional/mental state check
- Gratitude moment
- Strategic adjustments

## Voice-to-Text Technical Notes

### The Question: Can we do this free/cheap?

**Option 1: Browser Web Speech API (FREE)**
- Built into modern browsers
- Quality varies by browser/device
- Works offline in some cases
- Limitation: Not available on all mobile browsers, accuracy inconsistent

**Option 2: Whisper (OpenAI API)**
- ~$0.006 per minute of audio
- 10,000 users × 5 min voice notes/week = $300/month
- Very accurate, handles accents well
- Could be premium feature to offset cost

**Option 3: Self-hosted Whisper**
- Run Whisper model on our servers
- Upfront server cost, but no per-request cost
- Need GPU server (~$50-200/month depending on load)
- At 10k users, likely cheaper than API

**Option 4: Ollama / Local Models**
- Ollama runs on the USER'S device, not our servers
- Problem: Web apps can't easily trigger local Ollama
- Would work for desktop app, not web
- Not viable for mobile-first approach

**Recommendation:**
- Start with Browser Web Speech API (free) for MVP
- Add Whisper API as premium feature
- If scale justifies, move to self-hosted Whisper

## Dashboard Integration

### "Tracking" Section on Dashboard
- Badge system: "3 items need review"
- Progress indicators: "Weekly review: 5/7 days logged"
- Quick-access buttons to start session, write report, do review
- Unlock progress for monthly/quarterly reviews

### What Triggers "Needs Review"
- Session completed but no field report written
- Weekly review due (Sunday prompt)
- Monthly review unlocked but not done
- Sticking point not updated in X weeks

---

## Answered Questions

### Required vs Optional?
**All optional, BUT completing items unlocks features:**
- Weekly reviews unlock monthly reviews
- Monthly reviews unlock quarterly reviews
- Consistent tracking might unlock community features, badges, etc.

### Prompting vs Self-Directed?
**Mostly self-directed with smart prompts:**
- Dashboard shows what needs attention
- "Needs review" badges
- Optional push notifications (user controls frequency)
- No nagging, just gentle visibility

### Privacy Levels?
**[THOUGHT BOX - Decide Later]**
- Private only
- Share with coach
- Share with accountability partner
- Share publicly (anonymized?)

### Mobile vs Desktop?
**Mobile-first for everything, especially:**
- Live session tracking (must work perfectly on phone)
- Quick field reports
- Voice memos

Desktop-enhanced for:
- Deep dive reports
- Weekly/monthly reviews
- Progress visualization (bigger graphs)

### Voice Memos?
**Consider as premium feature** - see Voice-to-Text section above

### Community Stats?
**YES - implement this:**
- Anonymous aggregates
- Benchmarks with context
- "Users who do X see Y results"
- Always frame as inspiration, not competition

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don't make it feel like homework → **Solution: Full customization so it feels personal**
- Don't create anxiety about "falling behind" → **Solution: Gentle prompts, no guilt**
- ~~Don't over-quantify~~ → **Actually, DO quantify - it makes progress tangible and fun. Daygame guys are analytical.**
- ~~Don't compare users to each other~~ → **Community benchmarks are fine, but always remind: "Your only competition is your past self"**
- Don't let perfect tracking become procrastination from actual approaching → **Solution: Make quick-log so fast there's no excuse**

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **Live Session Tracker** - Core differentiator, guys love this
2. **Field Report Templates** - With customization system
3. **Weekly Review** - With template cards
4. **Progress Visualization** - Connected to session tracker
5. **Monthly/Quarterly Reviews** - With unlock mechanics
6. **Community Stats** - Once we have enough users
7. **Voice-to-Text** - Premium feature or later phase
