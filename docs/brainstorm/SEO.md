## Strategic Direction

### Key Insight: Narrow Go-to-Market, Broad Foundation

**Content should ADD VALUE, not just serve as marketing.** Someone should be able to read an article, never sign up, and still have their life improved. The app is for people who want to go deeper.

**Positioning:** Performance psychology and deliberate self-improvement, with daygame as the primary (but not only) application.

**Why this matters:**
- Personal interest extends beyond daygame (performance psychology, masculinity, living intentionally)
- Life circumstances change (e.g., getting a girlfriend)
- Rebranding later is harder than building a broad foundation now
- The principles (deliberate practice, self-reflection, inner game, managing fear) ARE universal

**The model:** Think Mark Manson. Started with dating advice/daygame, evolved into broader life advice and philosophy. The foundation should support this trajectory.

## Content Production Strategy

### The Core Tension

**Goal:** Build a massive content library for SEO (hundreds of articles)
**Constraint:** Authenticity matters, AI-generated content often feels hollow
**Reality:** Writing 1200 words personally takes ~20 hours; that doesn't scale

### Chosen Approach: Tiered Content Quality

| Tier | Format | Production | Volume | Purpose |
|------|--------|------------|--------|---------|
| **Flagship** | Long-form, personal essays | You write, 10-20 hrs | 1-2/month | Authority, virality, depth |
| **Standard** | Research summaries, frameworks | AI draft + your edit (1-2 hrs) | 4-8/month | SEO, value, breadth |
| **Quick** | Bullet points, takeaways, quotes | AI compiles + light edit (15-30 min) | 10-20/month | SEO coverage, internal links |

### Formats That Scale Well

| Format | Example | Why It Works |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Research summaries | "What the Science Says About Self-Compassion" | Reporting facts, not opinions |
| Framework breakdowns | "The AAR Method Explained" | Teaching a system |
| Quote compilations | "25 Quotes on Handling Rejection" | Curation, not creation |
| Comparison posts | "Tom Torero vs. Todd V: Different Approaches" | Analysis of existing material |
| How-to guides | "How to Write a Field Report (Step by Step)" | Instructional, structured |
| Checklists/templates | "Pre-Session Checklist" | Practical tools |

### YouTube Synergy
- Write article → Record talking through it → Two pieces of content from one effort
- YouTube builds personal brand faster than blog
- Blog captures search traffic YouTube misses

---

## Voice & Authorship

**You are the face.** Articles are from your perspective, your name, your experience.

**But production is assisted.** For non-flagship content:
- Research and structure by AI
- Personal takes, stories, and polish by you

### Voice Guidelines

| Aspect | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Tone | Direct, no-BS, encouraging but not soft |
| Perspective | First person, your experience when relevant |
| Humor | Dry, self-deprecating when appropriate |
| Vulnerability | Share struggles, not just wins |
| Authority | Confident but not preachy; "here's what I've found" not "here's THE truth" |
