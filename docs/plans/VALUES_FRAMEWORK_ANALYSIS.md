**Description:** "Magnetism draws people in. These values are about how you show up in the world - your ability to command attention, create attraction, and make others feel your energy."

**Daygame Relevance:** "Charisma isn't about being loud or performing. It's about being fully present, genuinely warm, and unapologetically yourself. Women feel your presence before they hear your words."

- Authenticity (NEW)
- Charisma (NEW)
- Charm (NEW)
- Humor (NEW)
- Presence (NEW)
- Social intelligence (NEW)
- Vulnerability (NEW)
- Warmth (NEW)
- Wit (NEW)
- Style (NEW)
- Self-expression (replaces Expressive from PLAY)
- Adventure (NEW - could also go in DRIVE)
- Magnetism (NEW - optional)

### Updated Category Order

1. **DISC** - Discipline, Structure & Performance (foundation)
2. **PRES** - Presence, Charisma & Social Magnetism (NEW - social impact)
3. **DRIVE** - Courage, Drive & Intensity (action)
4. **ID** - Self-Worth & Identity (inner foundation)
5. **EMO** - Emotional Regulation & Inner State (emotional mastery)
