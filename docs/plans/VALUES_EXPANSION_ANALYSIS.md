## Values to Remove (Bloat)

| Remove | Reason | Keep Instead |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Decisiveness | Same as Decisive | Decisive |
| Skillfulness | Same as Skill | Skill |
| Trustworthy | Same as Trust | Trust (and add Trustworthiness as noun form) |

## Naming Convention Decisions

### Standardize to nouns where natural:
- Expressive → Self-expression (move to PRES)
- Spontaneous → Spontaneity
- Reflective → Reflection
- Intuitive → Intuition

### Keep adjectives where they feel more natural as values:

- Thoughtful (not "Thoughtfulness")
- Capable (not "Capability")

### Compound forms (Self-X) - keep as is:
- Self-reliance
