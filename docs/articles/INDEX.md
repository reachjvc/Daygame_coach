## For Claude: Article Work Instructions

When asked to "work on articles" or "work on the newest article":

1. **Read this file first** to understand the content philosophy
2. **Check `docs/articles/` subfolders** for articles in progress
3. **For each article, read its `manifest.json`** which specifies:
   - Required research documents to read
   - Current draft version and feedback
   - Section structure
   - Key research points to incorporate
4. **Read ALL required context** listed in manifest before writing anything
5. **Read any existing `feedback{N}.json`** for structured feedback to apply

**Current articles in progress:**
| Article | Folder | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| The 80/20 Rule | `01-8020-rule/` | Draft 1, needs revision based on feedback |

## Content Creation Philosophy

**IMPORTANT: Value-First Approach**

When generating article ideas or content for this project, follow this sequence:

1. **Read the research FIRST** - Immerse yourself in the actual findings, studies, and insights (e.g., FIELD_REPORT_RESEARCH_PLAN.md)
2. **Find what's genuinely valuable** - What surprised you? What's counterintuitive? What would actually help someone?
3. **THEN consider SEO** - Only after you have valuable ideas, check SEO.md for discoverability optimization

**Why this order matters:**

- SEO-first priming leads to "what can we rank for?" thinking
- This produces mechanical, algorithm-optimized content that feels lifeless
- Value-first produces content that's genuinely interesting, which THEN gets optimized
- Google increasingly rewards genuine expertise and helpfulness over keyword stuffing

**The test:** Would this article be worth reading if search engines didn't exist?

## Article Concepts

### 1. The 80/20 Rule for Learning from Social Interactions

**Core insight:** 80% of your learning comes from 20% of your experiences. Most people waste time documenting everything when they should focus on emotional tipping points.

**Key research to draw from:**
- Skilled Seducer's "3 minutes before you lost her" concept
- BJJ Scout method: analyze the "lead-up" to key moments, not just the moments
- Sports psychology: shorter, sharper debriefs work better

**Hook:** "Stop writing novels about every conversation. Here's what actually matters."

**Structure:**
1. The problem with detailed logging (diminishing returns)
2. What the 80/20 principle means for reflection
3. How to identify emotional tipping points
4. The "critical 3 minutes" framework
5. Practical template for focused analysis

**Counterintuitive element:** Less documentation often leads to MORE learning.

### 2. Reflection vs. Rumination: Why Thinking About Your Mistakes Can Make You Worse

**Core insight:** 1/3 of the time, feedback actually DECREASES performance. The difference between productive reflection and harmful rumination is crucial.

**Key research to draw from:**
- Kluger & DeNisi meta-analysis: feedback is "like gambling"
- Rick Hanson's distinction: reflection is productive, rumination is repetitive and self-flagellating
- CBT research on cognitive distortions
- Time limits and "circuit breakers" for processing

**Hook:** "If you feel worse after journaling, you're doing it wrong."

**Structure:**
1. The shocking research: feedback often harms performance
2. Reflection vs. rumination: the critical distinction
3. Warning signs you've crossed into rumination
4. The circuit breaker: time limits and action requirements
5. Cognitive distortions that trap you (all-or-nothing, catastrophizing, mind-reading)
6. How to shift from "why did this happen?" to "what will I do next?"

**Counterintuitive element:** More analysis isn't always better. Sometimes you need to STOP thinking.

### 3. What Elite Athletes Know About Debriefing That You Don't

**Core insight:** Sports psychology has decades of research on optimal post-performance analysis. Most people ignore all of it.

**Key research to draw from:**
- Brian Cain's "Well, Better, How" method
- The 3-2-1 framework (3 highlights, 2 lowlights, 1 forward)
- Research showing positive framing affects future testosterone and performance
- Bandura's self-efficacy: mastery experiences build confidence

**Hook:** "Olympic coaches don't let athletes skip debriefs. Here's why."

**Structure:**
1. Why elite performers obsess over post-game analysis
2. The "Well, Better, How" framework explained
3. Why you MUST celebrate wins (it's not soft—it's science)
4. The hormonal impact of positive vs. negative framing
5. Building self-efficacy through mastery experiences
6. Your post-session protocol (practical template)

**Counterintuitive element:** Celebrating wins isn't feel-good fluff—it literally affects your hormones and future performance.

### 4. The Military's Secret Learning System (And How to Apply It)

**Core insight:** The US Army's After Action Review is called "one of the most successful organizational learning methods ever devised." It's four simple questions.

**Key research to draw from:**
- US Army FM 7-0 AAR methodology
- Wharton/HBR research on AAR effectiveness
- Peter Senge's warning: AARs fail when "reduced to sterile technique"
- Critical success factors: timing, psychological safety, focus on WHAT not WHO

**Hook:** "The US Army spent decades perfecting how to learn from failure. Here's their system."

**Structure:**
1. Origin story: how the Army developed AAR after Vietnam
2. The four core questions (intended vs. actual, gap analysis, adaptation)
3. Why most people get it wrong (Peter Senge's critique)
4. The critical success factors
5. Psychological safety: analyzing WHAT happened, not WHO to blame
6. Adapting AAR for personal development

**Counterintuitive element:** The military's system is surprisingly non-hierarchical and blame-free.

### 5. Why "Just Be Confident" Doesn't Work: Building Real Self-Belief Through Mastery

**Core insight:** Confidence isn't something you summon—it's built through specific mechanisms. Psychology research identifies four sources of self-efficacy.

**Key research to draw from:**
- Bandura's four sources of self-efficacy (mastery, vicarious, social persuasion, physiological)
- Dweck's growth mindset: the power of "yet"
- Duckworth's grit research: perseverance correlates with success more than IQ
- The counterintuitive finding: navigating setbacks creates STRONGER belief than never facing difficulty

**Hook:** "'Just be confident' is useless advice. Here's how confidence actually works."

**Structure:**
1. Why "fake it till you make it" fails
2. Bandura's four sources of self-efficacy
3. Why mastery experiences are the #1 confidence builder
4. The paradox: setbacks can build stronger belief than easy wins
5. Growth mindset: adding "yet" to your vocabulary
6. Grit: why perseverance beats talent
7. Practical confidence-building protocol

**Counterintuitive element:** Successfully navigating failure creates stronger confidence than never failing.

### 6. The Habit Science of Consistent Self-Improvement

**Core insight:** Knowing what to do isn't the problem—doing it consistently is. Habit science has cracked this.

**Key research to draw from:**
- BJ Fogg's B=MAP formula (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt)
- Implementation intentions research: 3x goal achievement with "if-then" planning
- Habit formation statistics: 59-66 days median, tracking increases success 40%
- Identity-based habits: "I am someone who reflects" beats "I should reflect"

**Hook:** "You don't need more motivation. You need a better system."

**Structure:**
1. The real reason people don't stick to self-improvement
2. The B=MAP formula: when behavior happens
3. Tiny habits: start so small you can't fail
4. Implementation intentions: "When X, I will Y"
5. Habit stacking: attach new behaviors to existing routines
6. Identity shift: becoming vs. doing
7. The power of streaks and tracking
8. Your habit-formation protocol

**Counterintuitive element:** Making the habit smaller (not relying on willpower) is the key to consistency.

## Notes for Content Creation

When writing any of these articles:

1. **Lead with the counterintuitive hook** - What surprises people or challenges assumptions
2. **Cite the research** - Name researchers, link studies, show your work
3. **Make it actionable** - End sections with practical steps, not just theory
4. **Use the research document** - FIELD_REPORT_RESEARCH_PLAN.md has extensive citations and details
5. **Test against the value question** - Would someone share this even if it didn't rank?

### SEO Considerations (Apply AFTER value is established)

Once an article concept is solid, THEN check:
- Does this match search intent for relevant keywords?
- Can we naturally incorporate target terms?
- What's the competitive landscape?
- See SEO.md for keyword research and optimization guidelines

**Remember:** Great content that ranks > optimized content that's mediocre.
