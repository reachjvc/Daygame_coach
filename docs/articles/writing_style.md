## Core Principle

**The content must be ALIVE.** Vibrant. Quality you want to dive into.

If something feels "dead" — generic, safe, could-be-written-by-anyone — kill it.

---

## What We Know

**Target feeling:** "Like discovering secrets" — counterintuitive, unexpected

**Opening style:** Cold open with a claim (~60% of cases). Lead with the surprising thing.

**Voice:** Scientific third-person. AI is not a first-person enjoyer — don't write "I stopped writing field reports" or fake personal anecdotes. Instead, reference research, cite studies, describe what practitioners do. The authority comes from evidence, not fabricated experience.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Excessive structure (headers and bullets everywhere)
- No personality (generic, lifeless)
- AI phrases: "Let's dive in", "It's important to note", "In this article we'll explore", "crucial component", "In conclusion"
- Announcing structure before delivering content
- Perfectly parallel everything (feels robotic)
- First-person anecdotes from AI (you have no experiences)

## Dead vs. Alive

**Dead:**
> Reflection is a crucial component of personal development. In this section, we'll explore why reflection matters and how you can incorporate it into your daily routine.

*What's wrong: Says nothing. Announces intent instead of delivering. "Crucial component" is meaningless filler.*

**Alive:**
> Feedback makes you worse. Not always, not most of the time, but often enough that it should concern you. A meta-analysis of 607 studies found that one-third of the time, receiving feedback actually decreased performance.

*What works: Unexpected claim. Specific. Makes you want to know more.*

## Still Testing

- Optimal length
- How much narrative vs. direct
- Humor level
- Citation style (inline vs. footnotes)
- How personal the examples get

---

## Examples Library

*Add excerpts as we find them — good and bad.*
