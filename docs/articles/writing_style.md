## Types of articles & target segment
**tier one** Our core segment, currently, are men age 25-40 that want to improve their dating life, specifically through daygame. 
**tier two** men that generally want to improve their dating life
**tier three** men that generally want to improve their life

The tiers function as ways to think about our writing. We want some articles to have a broad appeal, and many smaller articles to focus narrowly on our core segment.


## Core Principle

**The content must be ALIVE.** Vibrant. Quality you want to dive into.

If something feels "dead" — generic, safe, could-be-written-by-anyone — kill it.

---

## What We Know

**Target feeling:** "Like discovering secrets" — counterintuitive, unexpected

**Opening style:** Cold open with a claim (~60% of cases). Lead with the surprising thing.

**Voice:** Scientific third-person. AI is not a first-person enjoyer — don't write "I stopped writing field reports" or fake personal anecdotes. Instead, reference research, cite studies, describe what practitioners do. The authority comes from evidence, not fabricated experience.

**Specificity with research:** Citing specific researchers by name + concrete findings (e.g., "Anders Ericsson's research on deliberate practice found...") creates credibility. Generic claims ("research shows...") feel hollow. The specificity signals genuine knowledge rather than filler.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Excessive structure (headers and bullets everywhere)
- No personality (generic, lifeless)
- AI phrases: "Let's dive in", "It's important to note", "In this article we'll explore", "crucial component", "In conclusion"
- Announcing structure before delivering content
- Perfectly parallel everything (feels robotic)
- First-person anecdotes from AI (you have no experiences)

## Dead vs. Alive

**Dead:**
> Reflection is a crucial component of personal development. In this section, we'll explore why reflection matters and how you can incorporate it into your daily routine.

*What's wrong: Says nothing. Announces intent instead of delivering. "Crucial component" is meaningless filler.*

**Alive:**
> Feedback makes you worse. Not always, not most of the time, but often enough that it should concern you. A meta-analysis of 607 studies found that one-third of the time, receiving feedback actually decreased performance.

*What works: Unexpected claim. Specific. Makes you want to know more.*

---

## Revision Rules

**Match the scope of revision to the scope of the flag.**

- Flag on a **sentence/phrase** → Rewrite that sentence. Offer 2-3 alternatives.
- Flag on a **whole section** → Rewrite the section. Try a different angle entirely.
- Mixed flags (liked some parts, flagged others) → Preserve what works, replace what doesn't.

**What each flag means for revision:**

| Flag | Scope: Sentence | Scope: Section |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Excellent | Keep exactly | Keep exactly |
| Good | Keep as-is | Keep as-is |
| Almost | Small tweak | Small tweaks |
| AI | 2-3 alternative sentences | New angle, different structure |
| Angle | 2-3 alternative sentences | Start over, fresh direction |
| Note | Follow the specific instruction | Follow the specific instruction |

**The test:** If a flag asks for change and your revision is >80% the same words, you didn't revise — you edited. When something is flagged AI or Angle, the structure itself is the problem. Polishing broken structure produces polished broken structure.

**Default to alternatives over "best guess."** Especially for AI/Angle flags, give options rather than picking one. Let the editor choose.

## Connecting Facts (Red Thread)

Facts alone aren't enough. Before including a fact, ask: "What's the point of this fact for the article?" and "How does it connect to the others?"

**Disconnected (research bot):**
> *A third of the time, analyzing your performance makes you worse.*
>
> *Rugby players who reviewed their successes showed higher testosterone.*
>
> *Anders Ericsson found gains cluster in specific moments.*

**Connected (article):**
> *Research on feedback reveals a weird fact: a third of the time, reviewing actually makes you worse. The reason, a 607-study meta-analysis found, is that when review becomes egoic — self-criticizing rather than task-focused — learning stops.*
>
> *A 2012 study on rugby players showed the opposite when focus shifted. Players who watched video of their successes had 28-51% higher testosterone before the next game than those who watched mistakes.*

The difference: the second version includes the WHY (egoic/self-criticizing) and connects the facts ("showed the opposite when focus shifted").

---

## Weaving vs. Announcing

**Tendency to avoid:** Stating facts, then explaining them in separate sentences. Sources as standalone announcements.

**AI version:**
> *A third of the time, analyzing your performance makes you worse. That's the finding from Kluger and DeNisi's meta-analysis of 607 studies on feedback. More isn't better.*

**Human version:**
> *Research on feedback reveals a weird fact: a third of the time, reviewing actually makes you worse. The reason, a 607-study meta-analysis found, is that when review becomes egoic — self-criticizing rather than task-focused — learning stops.*

The AI version separates fact → source → summary. The human version weaves them together and includes the mechanism in the same breath.

Note: This is one pattern from one article. Not a rule for every sentence.

---

## Additional AI Tells

Add to anti-patterns list:
- TED-talk setups: "Here's a strange finding:", "Here's a stranger one:"
- Short punchy summary sentences that add nothing: "More isn't better.", "The difference isn't whether you reflect. It's how."
- "That's not X. It's Y." rhetorical structures
- Announcing sources as standalone sentences: "That's the finding from X's study."

**Exception:** Short punchy endings CAN work when specific to the content:
- BAD (generic): "More isn't better."
- GOOD (specific): "The review itself wasn't the variable. The focus was."

The difference: the good version refers to something concrete from this paragraph (review, focus). The bad version is a generic summary that could go anywhere.

---

## Offering Variations

When asked for variations of a word or phrase:
- Don't just swap synonyms — reword the whole sentence or paragraph
- Offer 3 curated options with brief reasoning, not 10 undifferentiated options
- Different structures matter more than different words

**Example:** Asked for variations of "But a 2012 study..."

BAD approach: 10 connector words (But, However, Yet, Still...)

GOOD approach: 3 paragraph rewrites with different structures:
1. Lead with the flip: "The opposite showed up in rugby..."
2. Lead with the outcome: "Rugby players who reviewed their successes had 28-51% higher testosterone..."
3. Weave the contrast in: "A 2012 rugby study found the reverse: players who watched video of their successes, not their mistakes..."

---

## When Editor Expresses Doubt

Don't agree just because the editor isn't sure. Either:
- Defend the choice with reasoning
- Ask them to articulate what's bothering them

Agreeing without a basis is sycophancy, not collaboration.

---

## Stacking Convergence Examples

Quick-fire lists of unrelated domains that landed on the same pattern build credibility through volume:

> *BJJ coaches study what happened before the submission. US Army after-action reviews focus on 3-4 key moments. Poker players journal the hands that felt off, not every hand played. Sports psychologists and surgeons converged on the same thing: analyze one or two moments deeply, let the rest go.*

Short, parallel, each domain gets one sentence. The accumulation makes the point.

---

## Still Testing

- Optimal length
- How much narrative vs. direct
- Humor level
- Citation style (inline vs. footnotes)
- How personal the examples get

---

## Examples Library

*Add excerpts as we find them — good and bad.*
