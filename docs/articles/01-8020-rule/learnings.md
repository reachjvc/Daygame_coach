**Excellent** on: "Anders Ericsson's research on deliberate practice found the same asymmetry: most time spent "practicing" generates nothing. The gains cluster in specific moments of struggle. Everything outside those moments is maintenance at best."

**Why it works:** This works because it's so specific, and such an interesting fact. It does not necessarily fit everywhere, but when it does fit, it's a great way of doing it.
