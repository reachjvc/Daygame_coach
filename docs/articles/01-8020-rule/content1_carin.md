### Core Insight
A third of the time, reviewing your performance makes you worse — the difference is whether you focus on ego or task.

### Surprising Facts
1. 607-study meta-analysis: 1/3 of feedback interventions decreased performance
2. Rugby study: players reviewing successes had 28-51% higher testosterone before next game
3. Working memory holds only 4-7 items — exhaustive analysis literally overwhelms the brain
4. Gains cluster in "specific moments at the edge of current ability" — most practice time generates nothing

### Quotable Lines
1. "The lock is just the full stop at the end of a sentence. It's the sentence that counts." — John Danaher
2. "The review itself wasn't the variable. The focus was."
3. "By the time someone taps, the outcome was already decided."
4. "The brain protects itself by forgetting most of it."
5. "The moments that stick aren't random. They're the ones that carried emotional weight."

### Frameworks
1. **The 3 Questions:** What happened 30 sec before? What were you trying to do? What would you try differently?
2. **Convergence Pattern:** BJJ → Army → Poker → Surgeons → Sports psych all landed on same insight
3. **Amygdala Flagging:** Emotionally charged moments get tagged for stronger encoding

## YouTube Long-Form Ideas

### 1. "Why Reviewing Your Mistakes Makes You Worse" (Recommended)
- **Hook:** "A third of the time, analyzing your performance actually makes you worse. 607 studies proved it."
- **Angle:** Lead with the counterintuitive finding, then reveal what separates productive review from harmful
- **Key segments:** The damaging 1/3 → Rugby testosterone study → What Danaher/Army/poker players all figured out → The 3 questions
- **Why this works:** Opens with tension, delivers actionable framework, science-backed credibility

### 2. "What John Danaher Knows About Learning That You Don't"
- **Hook:** "The most successful BJJ coach in history doesn't study the finish. Here's what he studies instead."
- **Angle:** Use Danaher as entry point, expand to the universal pattern
- **Key segments:** Danaher's method → Why the "lead-up" matters → Same pattern everywhere → Application
- **Why this works:** Danaher has name recognition, curiosity gap

### 3. "The Science of Why You Remember What You Remember"
- **Hook:** "Your brain already knows which moments matter. The amygdala tags them automatically."
- **Angle:** Focus on the neuroscience of emotional memory as the guide to what's worth analyzing
- **Key segments:** Amygdala flagging → Zheng et al research → Why exhaustive review fails (cognitive load) → Trust your brain
- **Why this works:** Novel angle, neuroscience fascination, practical implication

## YouTube Shorts Ideas

### 1. "The 1/3 Rule" (Recommended)
- **Hook (first 2 sec):** "A third of the time, feedback makes you WORSE."
- **Core content:** 607 studies. Not sometimes — a third of the time. The difference? Ego vs task focus. Self-criticism shuts learning down.
- **CTA/ending:** "What matters isn't whether you review. It's what you focus on."

### 2. "The John Danaher Learning Secret"
- **Hook (first 2 sec):** "John Danaher doesn't study submissions."
- **Core content:** "The lock is just the full stop. It's the sentence that counts." By the time someone taps, it was already decided. Study what happened BEFORE.
- **CTA/ending:** "The finish isn't the lesson. The setup is."

### 3. "The Rugby Testosterone Study"
- **Hook (first 2 sec):** "Rugby players who watched their mistakes had LOWER testosterone."
- **Core content:** 2012 study. Players who reviewed successes = 28-51% higher T before the next game. Same review time. Different focus. Different hormones.
- **CTA/ending:** "Your brain responds to what you feed it."

### 4. "Why Your Brain Forgets Most of Your Day"
- **Hook (first 2 sec):** "Your working memory holds 4 to 7 things. Max."
- **Core content:** That's why exhaustive analysis fails. Not because it's bad — because your brain literally can't process it. It protects itself by forgetting.
- **CTA/ending:** "Go deep on one moment. Let the rest go."

### 5. "5 Fields, Same Discovery"
- **Hook (first 2 sec):** "BJJ, Army, poker, surgery, sports psych — same discovery."
- **Core content:** All figured out: analyze 1-2 moments deeply, let the rest go. Not because the rest doesn't matter — because human learning can't process everything at once.
- **CTA/ending:** "Focus is the skill."

### 6. "The 3 Questions Framework"
- **Hook (first 2 sec):** "One moment. Three questions. That's it."
- **Core content:** What happened in the 30 seconds before? What were you trying to do? What would you try differently? That's the whole review.
- **CTA/ending:** "Stop reconstructing everything. Ask which moment you're still thinking about."

## LinkedIn Posts

### 1. "The 1/3 Finding" (Recommended)
- **Angle:** Lead with the meta-analysis, make it professional development applicable
- **Key points:** 607 studies found 1/3 of feedback decreases performance. The variable isn't whether you review — it's how. Ego-focused vs task-focused. Applicable to performance reviews, 1:1s, self-evaluation.

### 2. "What Elite Coaches Know"
- **Angle:** The convergence pattern — multiple fields, same insight
- **Key points:** Danaher, Army AARs, poker players, surgeons — all landed on "analyze 1-2 moments deeply." Why do we still write exhaustive reports?

### 3. "Your Brain Already Knows"
- **Angle:** The amygdala as your built-in importance filter
- **Key points:** The moment you're still thinking about hours later? That's the one worth analyzing. Your brain flagged it. Trust the flag.
