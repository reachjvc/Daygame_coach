## Trunk: Why Reviewing Your Mistakes Makes You Worse — YouTube Long-Form

**Target length:** 10-12 minutes
**Core promise:** Viewer learns why 1/3 of performance reviews backfire + a 3-question framework for productive self-analysis

### Hook (0:00-0:45)
**Opening line:** "A third of the time, reviewing your performance makes you worse. Not sometimes. Not occasionally. A third of the time. 607 studies confirmed it."

**Visual:** Black screen → "1/3" fades in large → shifts to meta-analysis graphic

**Why keep watching:** "In the next ten minutes, I'm going to show you what separates the reviews that build you up from the ones that tear you down. And it comes down to a single variable."

### Segment 1: The Testosterone Study (0:45-2:30)
- 2012 rugby study — players split into two groups
- Both watched video of themselves
- Group A: watched their successes
- Group B: watched their mistakes
- Result: Group A had 28-51% higher testosterone before next game
- **Key line:** "The review itself wasn't the variable. The focus was."

**Visual:** Split screen showing two players watching tape, hormone graphs

### Segment 2: The Ego vs Task Split (2:30-4:00)
- The meta-analysis explanation: egoic review shuts learning down
- Self-criticizing vs. task-focused
- Transition: "So if feedback can backfire, what do the best learners actually do?"

**Visual:** Two paths diagram — ego path leads to shutdown, task path leads to learning

### Segment 3: The Convergence Pattern (4:00-6:30)
- Five unrelated fields, same discovery
- **John Danaher (BJJ):** "The lock is just the full stop at the end of a sentence. It's the sentence that counts."
- **US Army AARs:** Limited to 3-4 critical moments per operation
- **Surgeons:** Review the minute before the complication
- **Poker players:** Journal the hands that felt off, not every hand
- **Sports psychologists:** Analyze 1-2 moments per game

**Visual:** Icons for each field appearing around central insight

**Key line:** "Not because the rest doesn't matter — because human learning can't process everything at once."

### Segment 4: The Neuroscience (6:30-8:30)
- Why the brain already knows which moments matter
- Amygdala tags emotionally significant experiences for stronger encoding
- Zheng et al (2022): amygdala → hippocampus pathway during emotional events
- The moments you're still thinking about hours later = amygdala flagged them
- Cognitive Load Theory: working memory holds 4-7 items
- Exhaustive analysis overwhelms the system → brain forgets to protect itself

**Visual:** Brain diagram showing amygdala-hippocampus connection, "4-7" overlay

### Segment 5: The Framework (8:30-10:00)
- Setup: "So instead of reconstructing everything, ask which moment you're still thinking about."
- **Three Questions:**
  1. What happened in the thirty seconds before that moment?
  2. What were you trying to do?
  3. What would you try differently?
- Beginner caveat: Early on, broader documentation helps. But that phase ends sooner than most think.

**Visual:** Clean slide with the 3 questions

### Ending (10:00-10:45)
- Callback: "Remember that 1/3 statistic? Now you know why."
- Final thought: "The question isn't whether you review. It's whether you're feeding the right moments back to yourself."
- **CTA:** "If you want the research papers I cited, link in the description."

**Visual:** Return to "1/3" graphic → fade to channel logo

A third of the time, reviewing your performance makes you worse — the difference is whether you focus on ego or task.

### Surprising Facts
1. 607-study meta-analysis: 1/3 of feedback interventions decreased performance
2. Rugby study: players reviewing successes had 28-51% higher testosterone before next game

## LinkedIn Posts

### 1. "The 1/3 Finding" (Recommended)
- **Angle:** Lead with the meta-analysis, make it professional development applicable

### 2. "What Elite Coaches Know"
- **Angle:** The convergence pattern — multiple fields, same insight
- **Key points:** Danaher, Army AARs, poker players, surgeons — all landed on "analyze 1-2 moments deeply." Why do we still write exhaustive reports?

### 3. "Your Brain Already Knows"
- **Angle:** The amygdala as your built-in importance filter
- **Key points:** The moment you're still thinking about hours later? That's the one worth analyzing. Your brain flagged it. Trust the flag.
