*Research on feedback reveals a counterintuitive finding: a third of the time, reviewing actually makes you worse. The reason, a 607-study meta-analysis found, is that when review becomes egoic — self-criticizing rather than task-focused — learning stops.*

*A 2012 rugby study found the reverse: players who watched video of their successes, not their mistakes, showed 28-51% higher testosterone before the next game. The review itself wasn't the variable. The focus was.*

*Anders Ericsson's research on deliberate practice points to why: improvement doesn't spread evenly across practice. It clusters in specific moments at the edge of current ability.*

*Unrelated fields keep landing on the same pattern. BJJ coaches study what happened before the submission. US Army after-action reviews focus on 3-4 key moments. Poker players journal the hands that felt off, not every hand played. Sports psychologists and surgeons converged on the same thing: analyze one or two moments deeply, let the rest go.*
