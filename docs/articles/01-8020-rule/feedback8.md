## INTRO ALTERNATIVES (Pick one)

### Option A: Lead with the 80/20 claim directly

Eighty percent of a field report teaches you nothing.

That's not a metaphor. A practitioner who logs twenty approaches will find maybe four worth analyzing. The rest are reps — useful for building comfort, useless for generating insight. The Pareto distribution shows up in learning the same way it shows up everywhere else.

The question is whether you can identify which 20% matters before you waste two hours documenting the 80% that doesn't.

Anders Ericsson's research on deliberate practice found the same asymmetry: most time spent "practicing" generates nothing. The gains cluster in specific moments of struggle. Everything outside those moments is maintenance at best.

Field reports work the same way. The learning isn't distributed evenly across your notes. It's concentrated in the moments something broke down — or almost did.

> this works because its so specific, and such an interesting fact. It does not necessarily fit everywhere, but when it does fit, its a great way of doing it
