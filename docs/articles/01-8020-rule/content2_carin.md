## Trunk: Why Reviewing Your Mistakes Makes You Worse

**Target length:** 8-10 minutes

---

### HOOK (0:00-0:45)

A 607-study meta-analysis on feedback found that a third of the time, reviewing your performance actually makes it worse. The reason: when review becomes self-critical rather than task-focused, learning stops.

### SEGMENT 1: The Focus Variable (0:45-2:45)

A 2012 rugby study showed the reverse. Players were split into two groups — both watched video of themselves, same amount of time. One group watched their successes. The other watched their mistakes.

Before the next game, the success group had 28-51% higher testosterone. Same review process, different focus, different physiological readiness.

The mechanism matters: self-criticism puts the body into a defensive state. The players watching mistakes weren't learning from them — they were being worn down by them.

### SEGMENT 2: The Pattern (2:45-5:30)

John Danaher, arguably the best grappling coach alive, tells his students not to study the submission. "The lock is just the full stop at the end of a sentence. It's the sentence that counts." By the time someone taps, the outcome was already decided — the grip established earlier, the angle created, the weight shifted. The finish was inevitable. The interesting part happened before.

The same pattern shows up everywhere. US Army after-action reviews limit discussion to 3-4 critical moments per operation. Surgeons review the minute before a complication, not the whole procedure. Poker players journal the hands that felt off, not every hand. Sports psychologists train athletes to analyze one or two moments per game.

Not because the rest doesn't matter — because human learning can't process everything at once.

### SEGMENT 3: Why the Brain Already Knows (5:30-7:30)

James McGaugh's research on emotional memory found that the amygdala tags significant moments for stronger encoding — surprise, challenge, tension. Zheng et al. (2022) traced the pathway: during emotionally charged events, the amygdala signals the hippocampus to consolidate the memory.

The moments you're still thinking about hours later are the ones your brain flagged. You don't have to figure out what matters. Your brain already did.

Cognitive Load Theory explains why analyzing everything fails: working memory holds four to seven items. Try to process an entire session and the system gets overwhelmed. The brain protects itself by forgetting most of it.

### SEGMENT 4: Three Questions (7:30-9:00)

Instead of reconstructing everything, start with which moment you're still thinking about.

Then:
- What happened in the thirty seconds before?
- What were you trying to do?
- What would you try differently?

One caveat: early on, when everything feels foreign, broader notes help build pattern recognition. But that phase ends sooner than most think. After fifty or a hundred sessions, depth beats breadth.

---

### ENDING (9:00-9:30)

The rugby players watching their successes weren't ignoring their weaknesses — they were building from a state of readiness instead of defense. The Danaher students weren't skipping the finish — they were studying where outcomes actually get decided.
