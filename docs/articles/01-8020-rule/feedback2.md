## Section: emotional-tipping

### Original text:
```
One forum post that's circulated for years puts it bluntly: focus on "the emotional tipping points." The moments where you felt something shift — anxiety spike, sudden ease, confusion, momentum loss. Your emotional response is a surprisingly reliable marker for where the important stuff happened.

This reframes what a useful field report looks like. Instead of chronological play-by-play:

*"I opened with X, she said Y, I responded with Z..."*

You're hunting for the pivot:

*"It was going well until about two minutes in. I felt her attention drift. I tried to recover with a joke but it landed flat. What happened in those thirty seconds before I lost her?"*

One question does more work than ten paragraphs of documentation.
```

### Feedback:

**Note** (whole section): atleast for me, i need to know what this is. Perhaps we should add a feature so that i see the link in a popup, it should probably be something that i can ALWAYS spot before approving an article to send off
