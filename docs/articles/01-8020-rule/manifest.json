  "notes": "Contract revised 2026-02-05. Previous contract was too broad ('Social Interactions'), structure was repetitive (7 sections → 4), and contained unverifiable claims (3-2-1 framework, Brian Cain as researcher). Convergence argument now the centerpiece. Danaher quote replaces generic 'off the move'. Bjork properly attributed (was conflated with Ericsson). Cook & Crewther finding added.",

BJJ fight analysis, deliberate practice research, memory neuroscience, and sports psychology debriefing all converge independently: depth on the moments that mattered beats breadth across everything that happened.",
