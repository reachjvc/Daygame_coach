However, i might in the future get a document and only skim it and ship it, and then you might've flagged it without me seeing it, so in a case like this (which we need to add to relevant documents), we should flag it in a way that i will ALWAYS see and decide on, and if i try to publish the article, i should trigger a safety mechanism"
