# Feedback: The 80/20 Rule for Learning from Social Interactions

## Section: intro

### Original text:
```
Most of what you write in your notes is useless.

Not wrong, not harmful — just useless. Twenty interactions documented. Maybe two worth revisiting. Eighteen entries of "she smiled, I said X, she said Y" that will never produce a single insight no matter how many times you reread them.

Anders Ericsson's research on deliberate practice found the same pattern across domains: most time spent "practicing" generates nothing. The gains cluster in specific moments of struggle — the reps where something breaks down and gets rebuilt. Everything else is just showing up.

The question isn't whether you're reflecting. It's whether you're reflecting on the parts that matter.

> this is too AI, but the reason is that no1 would ever write this in a field report. Also, the opening isnt strong, because it doesnt match the title very well. What is this article trying to be? for field reports? for journaling in general? for all social interactions? consider who would even write notes about interactions, only that would happen in a field report, which is fine, but then the rest of it needs to look different too

**AI** (whole section)
