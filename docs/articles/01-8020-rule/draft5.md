# The 80/20 Rule for Field Reports

**Status:** Draft
**Updated:** 05-02-2026

---

Eighty percent of a field report is filler.

Not bad writing — just unnecessary writing. A practitioner who logs twenty approaches will find maybe three or four worth analyzing. The rest are reps. They build comfort, but documenting them in equal detail produces volume without insight. The Pareto distribution shows up in learning from experience the same way it shows up in everything else: a small fraction of what happened contains most of what's useful.

The question is whether you can identify that fraction before you spend two hours on the part that doesn't matter.

What's interesting is that completely unrelated fields have arrived at the same answer independently.

In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, John Danaher — arguably the most influential grappling coach of the last decade — teaches that a submission is not where the fight was won. "The lock is just the full stop at the end of a sentence," he's said. "It's the sentence that counts, and that sentence is control." When elite coaches review competition footage, they don't study the choke. They study the grips, the weight distribution, the small positional adjustments that made the finish inevitable thirty seconds before it happened. The submission is just when it became visible.

Anders Ericsson's research on deliberate practice found a parallel asymmetry in skill acquisition. His central finding, published in *Psychological Review* in 1993, was that once someone reaches an acceptable level of performance, ordinary practice stops producing improvement. Behavior automates. Additional years of repetition don't help — and in some fields, experienced practitioners actually perform worse than relative novices. What drives continued improvement is a specific kind of effort: working at the edge of current ability on things you can't yet do well. Robert Bjork, a cognitive psychologist at UCLA, formalized a related finding he called "desirable difficulties" — conditions that make learning feel harder in the moment but produce stronger long-term retention. "When you're asked to struggle with solving a problem before being shown how to solve it," Bjork found, "the subsequent solution is better learned and more durably remembered."

A [popular post on Skilled Seducer](https://www.skilledseducer.com/threads/stickied-how-to-write-efficient-field-reports-80-20-rule-time-hack.18988/) applies the same logic to field reports: focus on "the 3 minutes before you lost her." The moment she walked away isn't where you lost her. That's just when it became visible. The actual pivot happened earlier — something shifted in the energy, you missed a signal or sent the wrong one. That's the 20%. Not the whole conversation. The few minutes before the tipping point.

Three domains. Same conclusion. The learning isn't in the full record. It's in the specific moments where something was at stake and could have gone differently.

There's a neuroscience reason your brain already knows which moments those are.

Emotionally significant experiences are encoded through a different neural pathway than routine ones. Research by James McGaugh and subsequent work by Zheng et al. (published in *Nature Communications* in 2022) showed that emotional arousal triggers the amygdala to modulate hippocampal encoding — the mechanism that creates long-term memories. Emotionally charged moments get priority processing. The interaction you're still replaying an hour after a session? Your brain has already flagged it as significant. That's not rumination. That's a signal.

This has a practical implication beyond just learning. Cook and Crewther, studying professional rugby union players, found that how athletes reviewed their performance measurably affected their physiology before the *next* game. Players who received post-match video focused on their successes showed 28 to 51 percent higher pre-game testosterone concentrations before the following match, compared to players who reviewed their mistakes. The effect persisted for at least a week. A field report isn't just documentation. How you review shapes how you show up next time.

There's also a ceiling on how much analysis one session can support. Cognitive Load Theory, built on George Miller's 1956 finding that working memory holds roughly four to seven items, explains why trying to extract fifteen lessons from one outing means none of them consolidate. The constraint of focusing on one or two key moments isn't a compromise — it's how memory actually works. Depth on a few things beats shallow coverage of everything.

The practical shift is straightforward.

After a session, don't start writing immediately. Let it settle. Then ask: which moment am I still thinking about? That's the 20% — the interaction where something happened, good or bad, that you don't fully understand yet.

For that moment, three questions do the work of ten paragraphs:

- What were the three minutes leading up to the key moment?
- What shifted — in her, in yourself, in the dynamic?
- What would you do differently if you could replay it?

The other approaches gave you reps. They don't need analysis.

One caveat: beginners may not yet know what matters. Early on, detailed logging helps build pattern recognition — you're training your filter. But the goal is to graduate out of exhaustive documentation. At some point, your gut starts identifying the moments that deserve the deep dive, and the research suggests it's worth trusting that instinct. The brain is already doing the filtering. Conscious analysis just needs to follow where it's pointing.
