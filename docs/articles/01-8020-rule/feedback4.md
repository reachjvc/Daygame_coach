## Section: emotional-tipping

### Original text:
```
One forum post that's circulated for years puts it bluntly: focus on "the emotional tipping points." The moments where you felt something shift — anxiety spike, sudden ease, confusion, momentum loss. Your emotional response is a surprisingly reliable marker for where the important stuff happened.

This reframes what a useful field report looks like. Instead of chronological play-by-play:

*"I opened with X, she said Y, I responded with Z..."*

You're hunting for the pivot:

*"It was going well until about two minutes in. I felt her attention drift. I tried to recover with a joke but it landed flat. What happened in those thirty seconds before I lost her?"*

One question does more work than ten paragraphs of documentation.
```

### Feedback:

**Note** (whole section): this is an interesting type of thing. "a forum post", this should be flagged as a situation for review (in the future as well), because at least I the editor should have the option to link to that post, or to mention it more clearly. However, i might in the future get a document and only skim it and ship it, and then you might've flagged it without me seeing it, so in a case like this (which we need to add to relevant documents), we should flag it in a way that i will ALWAYS see and decide on, and if i try to publish the article, i should trigger a safety mechanism
