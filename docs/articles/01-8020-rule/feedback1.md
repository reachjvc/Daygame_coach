# Feedback: The 80/20 Rule for Learning from Social Interactions

## Section: intro

### Original text:
```
Most of what you write in your notes is useless.

Not wrong, not harmful — just useless. You document twenty interactions in careful detail, and maybe two of them actually teach you something. The rest is noise. Filler that felt productive while you were typing.

This isn't a character flaw. It's a pattern recognition problem. Your brain doesn't automatically know which moments matter, so it defaults to recording everything. The result: hours of journaling that produces almost no insight.

The Pareto principle — 80% of results from 20% of effort — applies to learning from experience just as ruthlessly as it applies to everything else. The question isn't whether you're reflecting. It's whether you're reflecting on the right things.

There's a concept in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu analysis called studying "off the move." When reviewing footage, elite coaches don't focus on the submission itself. They study what happened *before* — the grips, the weight distribution, the small adjustments that made the finish inevitable. The choke is just the final frame. The learning is in the lead-up.

The same principle applies to social interactions. The moment she walked away isn't where you lost her. That's just when it became visible. The actual pivot point happened earlier — maybe thirty seconds, maybe three minutes before. Something shifted. The energy changed. You missed a signal or sent the wrong one.

That's the 20% worth analyzing. Not the whole conversation. The three minutes before the tipping point.
```

### Feedback:

**Note** (whole section): this section is much more alive. it is not obvious at all that AI wrote it. I think the specificity of the example makes it good. however, for the last line, "thats the..." i think a real person might sometimes go even further, like my intuition is saying that sometimes ppl mention the pareto of the pareto, like, a fun thing to just even consider here would be explaining what would be the very most useful thing, i dno if i am making myself clear. Like "20 % worth analyzing, using the principle again on those 20%, we realize that the 4% that gives me most effectiveness, is XYZ" does that make sense?
