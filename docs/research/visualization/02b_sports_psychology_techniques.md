# Sports Psychology Visualization: Techniques and Protocols

**Research Date:** 2026-02-18
**Scope:** Evidence-based visualization methods used in sports psychology — specific protocols, timing, frequency, and how-to steps, not just that they exist.

---

## 1. Theoretical Foundations

### 1.1 Functional Equivalence Theory

The core principle underlying modern sports imagery: **imagined movement and actual movement activate overlapping neural networks**. Brain imaging studies show that motor imagery (MI) activates the primary motor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor area, and cerebellum — the same areas recruited during physical execution. This is why mental practice produces real physiological and performance changes, not just motivational boosts.

Implication: An imagery protocol should be designed to maximize this neural overlap. The more similar the imagined scenario is to the real one (environment, physical state, emotional state, timing), the stronger the functional equivalence and the more effective the training.

### 1.2 Bioinformational Theory (Lang, 1979)

Lang proposed that any imagined scenario activates an associative memory network composed of three types of stored information:

- **Stimulus propositions** — characteristics of the imagined situation (e.g., the competition venue, the crowd noise, the starting line)
- **Response propositions** — physiological and behavioral responses (e.g., increased heart rate, muscle tension, postural changes)
- **Meaning propositions** — the psychological significance of the stimulus-response pairing (e.g., "I am ready," "this moment matters")

**Key finding:** Imagery that activates response propositions (not just stimulus propositions) produces measurable physiological changes — increased heart rate, skin conductance, EMG activity — and leads to greater performance gains. Passive imagery ("I see a golf course") is weaker than active imagery ("I feel my heart rate rise, my grip tighten, my weight shift").

**Protocol implication:** Scripts and guided sessions must explicitly include response and meaning content, not just scene description. This is the basis for LSRT (see Section 3).

## 2. The PETTLEP Model

**Developed by:** Holmes & Collins (2001)
**Core claim:** Imagery is most effective when it is "functionally equivalent" to the real performance — achieved by making the imagined scenario match the real one across seven dimensions.

PETTLEP is the gold-standard framework for designing imagery interventions. Studies consistently show PETTLEP-based imagery outperforms non-PETTLEP imagery for performance gains.

### The Seven Components

#### P — Physical
The athlete's body should be in the same physical state as during actual performance.
- **How to apply:** Wear the actual kit, hold the actual equipment. A golfer should hold the club during imagery. A gymnast should be in practice clothes on the mat, not lying on a couch in street clothes.
- **Why it matters:** The sensory input from the body (proprioception, tactile) helps activate the same motor programs used during real performance.
- **Slowed-down version:** If physical access is impossible, the athlete at minimum imagines the physical sensations of holding/wearing their equipment.

#### E — Environment
Imagery conducted in the actual performance environment, or the most realistic simulation possible.
- **How to apply:** Stand on the actual court/pitch/track and close your eyes to visualize. If that is not possible, use photos, videos, or VR of the venue.
- **Rationale:** Environmental cues (sounds, smells, visual field) are stimulus propositions that prime the associated response networks.
- **Hierarchy:** On-site > recorded video > photos > description.

#### T — Task
The imagery content must match the athlete's actual current skill level, not some idealized expert version.
- **How to apply:** A beginner golfer should not imagine Tiger Woods's swing — they should imagine their own best execution. An athlete mid-rehabilitation imagines the movement as it is currently performed, not pre-injury.
- **Why it matters:** Imagining a movement beyond your current capability is not functionally equivalent to your own neuromuscular programs.
- **Progression:** As skill improves, update the imagined performance accordingly.

#### T — Timing
Real-time imagery is most functionally equivalent. Slow-motion has a specific, limited use case.
- **How to apply:** A 100-meter sprint should be imagined in approximately 10 seconds, not 30. A gymnastics routine of 90 seconds should be imagined for 90 seconds.
- **Slow motion exception:** Use slow motion deliberately to isolate and focus on technically difficult components (e.g., the exact moment of foot plant in a tackle). Then return to real-time.
- **Do not:** Use slow motion by default because it feels easier. It reduces functional equivalence.

#### L — Learning
Imagery content must evolve as the athlete's skill evolves.
- **How to apply:** Regularly re-examine and update imagery scripts. What the athlete images at the start of a season should differ from what they image at peak competition phase. The imagery should represent current optimal execution, not a frozen past snapshot.
- **In practice:** After a technique change, update the imagery script to match. This prevents rehearsing outdated movement patterns.

#### E — Emotion
Include the emotions that accompany actual performance — but regulate which emotions.
- **How to apply:** Include facilitative emotions (arousal, focus, excitement, determination) that accompany peak performance. Do not imagine fear, anxiety spirals, or panic.
- **Technique:** Before imaging, recall a moment of high performance and the emotional state that accompanied it. Bring that state into the imagery.
- **Why it matters:** Emotion activates meaning propositions in the bioinformational network, making the imagery more physiologically real and more transferable to competition.

#### P — Perspective
First-person (internal) vs. third-person (external) — each has optimal use cases.
- **Internal (first-person):** Seeing through your own eyes. Better for: open skills requiring timing (tackling, batting, returning a serve), tasks where kinesthetic feel is primary.
- **External (third-person):** Watching yourself as if on video. Better for: form-based tasks where spatial positioning and aesthetics matter (gymnastics, diving, technique correction).
- **Current guidance:** Individuals able to switch fluidly between perspectives maximize benefits by matching perspective to task. Many experienced athletes use both within a single session.

### PETTLEP Application: Step-by-Step Session

1. Athlete dons their kit or holds their equipment (Physical)
2. Session occurs at the venue or with venue footage/photos visible (Environment)
3. Athlete selects specific task content at current skill level (Task)
4. Practitioner cues athlete to begin; duration matches real-time execution (Timing)
5. Script includes current technical cues relevant to athlete's learning stage (Learning)
6. Script includes emotional language — the feeling of peak execution (Emotion)
7. Perspective chosen based on task type (Perspective)
8. Debrief: athlete rates vividness, identifies weaker sensory elements, notes emotional quality

### Evidence Summary

- PETTLEP imagery significantly improved performance compared to traditional imagery across a 2022 systematic review of 29 studies (MDPI Applied Sciences)
- Domains showing improvements: golf (bunker shots, full swing accuracy), basketball (shooting), strength (muscle activation), music performance (piano)
- Combined PETTLEP + physical practice consistently outperforms either alone

## 3. Layered Stimulus Response Training (LSRT)

**Developed by:** Williams & Cumming (University of Birmingham BRIO Group)
**Theoretical basis:** Lang's bioinformational theory
**Primary use case:** Athletes with weak or underdeveloped imagery ability; also used to deepen imagery quality for experienced imagers

### What Problem LSRT Solves

Many athletes — especially beginners — can only generate shallow imagery (visual scene only, no bodily sensation, no emotional response). This "stimulus only" imagery lacks the response propositions that drive physiological and performance change. LSRT is a structured method for teaching athletes to build richer, physiologically activated imagery from scratch.

### The Three Proposition Types (Lang's Framework Applied)

1. **Stimulus propositions** — concrete environmental details: venue, weather, crowd, the object being acted upon
2. **Response propositions** — physiological and behavioral responses: increased heart rate, muscle tension, breathing rate, sweat, postural changes
3. **Meaning propositions** — the psychological significance: "I am ready," "this is my moment," "I feel in control"

### Session Protocol

Each LSRT session cycles through four steps, repeated for each added layer:

**Step 1 — Initial Imagery**
The practitioner reads a base scenario script (e.g., "You are standing at the tee on the 18th hole..."). The athlete images the scenario for 10-15 seconds with whatever detail they can currently access.

**Step 2 — Evaluation and Reflection**
Athlete is asked: Which elements felt clear? Which felt vague or absent? What sensory modalities were present (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory)?

**Step 3 — Focused Re-imaging**
Athlete re-images the scenario, concentrating specifically on the elements identified as stronger. This builds confidence and solidifies those layers.

**Step 4 — Progressive Layering**
Practitioner introduces one new layer — typically a response proposition (e.g., "Now notice your heart rate rising as you approach the first serve") or a meaning proposition (e.g., "Feel the confidence that you have prepared for this"). Athlete images again. The cycle repeats.

### Session Parameters (Research Protocol)

- **Duration per image attempt:** 10-15 seconds
- **Attempts per session:** 5 images of the same scenario
- **Sessions:** 4 consecutive days in the Williams & Cumming (2013) study
- **Physical practice concurrent:** None required — LSRT improved both imagery ability AND performance (golf putting) in the absence of any physical practice
- **Practitioner role:** Active guidance; the practitioner helps the athlete identify missing layers and scaffolds complexity progressively

### Outcome Evidence

- Williams & Cumming (2013): LSRT group (vs. imagery-only control) showed improvement in kinesthetic MI ability, imagery of complex skills, and actual golf putting performance
- The improvement in performance occurred without any physical practice — purely through improved imagery quality
- 2025 study (Mathieson, Ginty, Williams): LSRT feasible for stress regulation, not only motor performance

## 4. Paivio's Imagery Function Framework

**Developed by:** Paivio (1985); extended by Hall et al. (1998) into the Sport Imagery Questionnaire (SIQ)
**Core claim:** Imagery functions through either cognitive or motivational mechanisms, each operating at either a specific or general level — producing five distinct imagery types, each with different optimal applications.

### The Five Imagery Types

#### CS — Cognitive Specific
**Definition:** Imagery of specific sport skills — the mechanics and execution of a single movement or technique.
**Examples:** Imagining the exact mechanics of a golf swing, the footwork of a tackle, the release point of a free throw.
**Best for:** Skill acquisition, technique refinement, motor program encoding.
**When to use:** Training phase, during skill development, before practicing a specific technique.

#### CG — Cognitive General
**Definition:** Imagery of strategies, game plans, or sequences of actions — the "chess moves" of sport.
**Examples:** A basketball point guard imagining the full-court press execution. A soccer player imagining a specific corner kick play. A tennis player imagining their serve-volley strategy.
**Best for:** Strategic preparation, team coordination, game planning.
**When to use:** Pre-competition phase, tactical preparation, team sports especially.

#### MS — Motivational Specific
**Definition:** Imagery of specific goals and goal-oriented behaviors.
**Examples:** Imagining receiving a gold medal, crossing the finish line first, lifting the trophy, hearing your name announced as the winner.
**Best for:** Motivation during training, goal commitment, sustaining effort through difficulty.
**When to use:** During fatigue in training, when motivation is low, for long-term goal reinforcement.

#### MG-A — Motivational General-Arousal
**Definition:** Imagery of emotional and arousal states — anxiety, stress, calm, excitement — in competition contexts.
**Examples:** Imagining the nervous feeling before a penalty kick, then managing it; imagining the crowd noise and staying focused; imagining the pressure and breathing through it.
**Best for:** Arousal regulation, anxiety management, pre-competition mental preparation.
**When to use:** Combined with MG-M to process competitive anxiety; teaching athletes to simulate and regulate their emotional response before it happens in real life.
**Caution:** Used incorrectly (without pairing with MG-M or CS), this can rehearse anxiety rather than regulate it. Best used under practitioner guidance.

#### MG-M — Motivational General-Mastery
**Definition:** Imagery of mental toughness, self-control, confidence, and coping.
**Examples:** Imagining handling adversity calmly, staying focused after an error, demonstrating confidence in body language, bouncing back from a missed shot.
**Best for:** Building sport confidence, mental toughness, resilience, pre-competition confidence.
**When to use:** Regularly throughout training; especially before competition to prime confidence state.

### Evidence-Based Recommendations

- MG-M and CS are the two most effective imagery types for performance — use these as the foundation
- CS enhances skill learning and motor memory
- MG-M enhances sport confidence (largest effect sizes for confidence outcomes)
- MG-A should be combined with MG-M and CS — not used alone
- More experienced athletes tend to use all five types; novices benefit most from CS + MG-M focus

### Practical Session Structure Using Paivio's Framework

A single 15-20 minute session might include:
1. Relaxation induction (2-3 min)
2. CS imagery — specific skill execution (5 min)
3. CG imagery — strategic plan for upcoming competition (3 min)
4. MG-M imagery — imagining confident, in-control version of self (4 min)
5. Brief MG-A sequence — imagining feeling pressure, then regulating it (2-3 min)

## 5. Internal vs. External Imagery Perspective

### Definitions

- **Internal (first-person):** Seeing through your own eyes, experiencing the imagery from within the body. Kinesthetic sensations are primary.
- **External (third-person):** Watching yourself from outside, as if on a video recording or as an observer.

### Research Findings on Which is Better

No single perspective is universally superior. Effectiveness is task-dependent and skill-level-dependent.

**Internal perspective works better for:**
- Open skills requiring timing and reaction (batting, returning a serve, tackling)
- Skills where kinesthetic feel is the key learning target
- Higher-skill athletes with existing motor competence for the skill
- Tasks where what you feel matters more than what you look like

**External perspective works better for:**
- Form-based and aesthetic sports (gymnastics, diving, synchronized swimming)
- Error correction — watching yourself make the error as a coach would see it
- Skill acquisition for novices — "mental observation" of correct form
- Tasks where spatial positioning and visual appearance are the output

**Key research finding:** The internal view serves to refine or revise an already-internalized gesture — requires existing motor competence. The external view is better for learning a gesture from scratch through "mental observation."

**The optimal athlete:** Can flexibly switch between perspectives within a session depending on what they are working on. Researchers recommend training both.

### Practical Protocol for Perspective Use

- Technique correction session: Begin with external (see the error, see the correction), then switch to internal (feel the corrected movement)
- Pre-competition routine: Internal perspective — experience the performance from the inside
- Learning a new pattern: External first to build the visual blueprint, then internal to embody it

## 6. Combined Action Observation and Motor Imagery (AOMI)

### What It Is

AOMI combines:
1. **Action observation (AO):** Watching a movement demonstration, typically via video
2. **Motor imagery (MI):** Simultaneously imagining the kinesthetic experience of performing that movement

The two are done at the same time (concurrent AOMI), not sequentially.

### Why It Works

Both AO and MI independently activate overlapping neural regions including the mirror neuron system and motor cortex. When combined simultaneously (congruent AOMI), the activation is additive — fMRI and TMS studies show greater corticomotor excitability during AOMI than either AO or MI alone.

### Specific Protocol

**Step 1 — Video selection:** Choose video of the target skill from the appropriate perspective (first-person or third-person depending on the goal). The model should ideally be a skilled performer at a level the athlete can recognize as correct.

**Step 2 — Audio preparation:** Add audio coaching cues or kinesthetic descriptors over the video to prompt response propositions during observation.

**Step 3 — Concurrent session structure (from research):**
- Observe the action on video: 3 minutes
- Simultaneously imagine performing the action (kinesthetic focus, not visual re-watching)
- Brief rest
- Repeat the observe+imagine cycle 3 times = approximately 12 minutes total
- Conduct 5 consecutive sessions

**Step 4 — Kinesthetic focus instruction:** Athletes are specifically instructed to focus on how it would feel to execute the movements, not just to watch passively. The imagery is internal-perspective kinesthetic imagery concurrent with the video.

**Step 5 — Debrief:** Discuss vividness, sensory engagement, and alignment between what was observed and what was imagined.

### Evidence

- PETTLEP-informed AOMI significantly improved accuracy compared to PETTLEP MI alone
- Congruent AOMI (both occurring simultaneously) outperforms alternate AOMI (watch, then imagine separately) for most tasks
- Golf putting, gymnastics jumping, and aiming tasks all show improvements

## 7. Pre-Competition Imagery Routines

### Structure

Pre-competition imagery is distinct from training imagery. The goals shift from acquisition to priming and activation. Research distinguishes three phases:

- **Pre-Competitive Activity Routine (PCA-R):** Upon arrival at the venue — long, broader routine; manages environment orienting
- **Pre-Performance Routine (PP-R):** Immediately before execution — short, high-focus, cue-based
- **Post-Performance Activity Routine (PPA-R):** After performance — used for learning and reset

### Timing Guidelines

- **Day before competition:** 10-15 minutes of CG (strategy) and MG-M (mastery/confidence) imagery. Full run-through of planned execution. Not too late at night — avoid heightening arousal before sleep.
- **Morning of competition:** Brief (5-10 min) MG-M and MS (goal) imagery; reinforce confidence and purpose
- **1-2 hours before:** Short relaxation + CS imagery of key technical elements. Do not introduce new content. Reinforce what is already prepared.
- **Immediately before performance (1-5 min before):** Brief imagery cue — a 10-30 second mental run-through of the opening sequence, key moment, or personal performance cue. This is a trigger, not a full session.

### Example Pre-Competition Script (structure, not verbatim)

1. **Relaxation phase (2-3 min):** Diaphragmatic breathing. Body scan to release tension in jaw, shoulders, hands. Reach a state of controlled calm.
2. **Environment anchoring (1 min):** Open senses to the actual venue — sounds, temperature, the feel of the ground. Then close eyes and hold the image.
3. **CS + internal perspective (3-5 min):** Run through 2-3 critical technical elements at real-time speed. Feel the execution. Imagine it successful and controlled.
4. **CG sequence (2 min):** If relevant — see the strategic plan execute correctly.
5. **MG-M close (1-2 min):** Anchor in the feeling of confidence, readiness, control. "I have prepared for this. I am ready."
6. **Physical trigger:** A specific physical action (e.g., two deep breaths, a specific hand movement) that signals "session complete, time to compete."

### Elite Athlete Example

Jonny Wilkinson (England rugby): Used pre-recorded audio scripts with imagery content, listened through headphones. Scripts included competition atmosphere sounds layered under guided imagery narration — "snippets of atmosphere from past matches included to enhance the sense of reality."

Emily Cook (Olympic freestyle skier): Recorded her own imagery script: "I'm standing on top of the hill. I can feel the wind on the back of my neck. I can hear the crowd..." then played it back before competition.

Michael Phelps: "Mental videotape" — a fully multi-sensory imagery routine conducted every night before sleep and each morning upon waking, covering every aspect of a successful race from block entry through finish and celebration.

## 8. Biofeedback-Enhanced Imagery

### What It Is

Biofeedback equipment provides real-time physiological data to the athlete during imagery. The athlete can see (or hear) their own heart rate, HRV, skin conductance, or EMG — and use this data to deepen imagery quality or learn to regulate physiological states.

### Modalities Used

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Biofeedback:**
- Most researched modality in sports
- Athletes train to increase HRV through resonance frequency breathing (typically 0.1 Hz = ~6 breaths/minute)
- Protocol: Determine individual resonance frequency → practice breathing at that rate while monitoring HRV feedback → layer imagery of performance over the regulated state
- Research shows HRV biofeedback significantly improves anxiety reduction, and basketball performance (shooting, passing, dribbling) compared to placebo and control
- Effect sizes are among the largest in sports psychology interventions

**EMG (Electromyography) Biofeedback:**
- Measures muscle tension in specific muscle groups
- Athletes learn to reduce tension in non-target muscles during imagery (e.g., relaxing jaw and shoulder during a golf imagery session)
- Used in combination with autogenic training and imagery scripts

**EEG Neurofeedback:**
- Athletes train specific brainwave patterns (alpha: 8-12 Hz, theta: 4-8 Hz, SMR: ~12-15 Hz)
- Alpha-theta neurofeedback guides the brain between relaxation (alpha) and deep associative states (theta) — states associated with imagery richness and memory access
- Protocol: 20-40 minute sessions with real-time EEG display; athlete learns to increase alpha/theta amplitudes through imagery and relaxation techniques
- Applied in shooting, swimming, judo, golf — with documented improvements in reaction time, technical accuracy, and anxiety reduction

### Combined Biofeedback + Imagery Protocol

1. Attach HRV or EMG sensors
2. Achieve resonance frequency breathing / target physiological state (visible on monitor)
3. While maintaining the regulated state, begin imagery session (practitioner-guided script or recorded audio)
4. Biofeedback confirms the athlete is maintaining the target physiological state during imagery — ensuring the imagery is activating rather than passive
5. Post-session: review biofeedback data to identify which imagery content produced strongest physiological activation

## 9. Guided Imagery Scripts: Structure and Protocols

### What Sports Psychologists Actually Do (Protocol Structure)

A formal guided imagery session conducted by a sport psychologist follows a consistent structure:

**Phase 1: Physical Setup (1-2 min)**
- Quiet, distraction-free environment
- Athlete in sport kit or appropriate clothing (PETTLEP Physical component)
- Seated or standing in sport-relevant posture — not lying down (which promotes sleep not activation)
- If possible: at the actual venue, or with venue imagery on screen

**Phase 2: Relaxation Induction (2-5 min)**
- "Close your eyes and begin deliberate diaphragmatic breathing."
- "Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 6. Repeat."
- Progressive body scan: "Release tension from your jaw... your shoulders... your hands..."
- Goal: controlled calm, not sleep. Activation level should match what is needed for the upcoming imagery task (for high-arousal sports, do not over-relax).

**Phase 3: Sensory Anchoring (1-2 min)**
- Invoke the performance environment through senses: "Hear the crowd... feel the surface beneath your feet... smell the air..."
- This activates stimulus propositions and primes the associated response networks.

**Phase 4: Core Imagery Content (5-15 min)**
- Content varies by goal (CS for skill, CG for strategy, MG-M for confidence)
- Delivered in second person ("You feel...") or first person ("I feel...")
- Includes response proposition language: "Notice your heart rate settling into a powerful, steady rhythm... your hands are firm and controlled..."
- Real-time pacing (PETTLEP Timing)
- Practitioner voice is calm, measured, and slightly slower than normal speech

**Phase 5: Closing and Integration (1-2 min)**
- "Bring awareness back to your breathing."
- Anchor the state with a physical trigger if used in competition routines.
- Brief verbal debrief: "On a scale of 1-7, how vivid was that? What did you feel most clearly?"

### Example Script Fragment (skill execution, internal perspective)

> "You are standing at the line. Feel the court under your feet — the slight give of the surface. The ball is in your hand; feel its texture and weight. The crowd noise fades to background. You see the basket clearly — the geometry of your shot is already mapped. Take your breath. As you rise, feel your legs drive, your elbow tracking perfectly... the ball leaves your fingertips with a smooth, clean release. The arc is exactly as intended. You watch it fall through."

### Recording Your Own Script

Athletes are often instructed to:
1. Write their script in the second person or first person — whichever feels more real
2. Record it as an audio file (phone memo app sufficient)
3. Speak slowly, with deliberate pacing for each imagined phase
4. Include sounds from the actual venue if available (layered under narration as Wilkinson did)
5. Listen to the recording 2-3x per week during training, and in pre-competition routine

## 10. Mental Practice vs. Physical Practice: Ratios and Integration

### What the Research Shows

Mental practice alone is better than no practice. Physical practice alone is better than mental practice alone. Combined practice is optimal, and the research on ratios provides practical guidance.

**Effect size comparison (meta-analysis findings):**
- Physical practice alone: ES = 0.79
- Combined mental + physical practice: ES = 0.62
- Mental practice alone: ES = 0.47

**Ratio research:** Studies testing 75% physical / 25% mental vs. 50/50 splits find that as the proportion of physical practice increases, performance improves — but combined conditions consistently outperform physical-only at equivalent total time (because mental practice allows additional repetitions without fatigue or injury risk).

### Practical Recommendations for Integration

**When mental practice is most valuable:**

1. **Injury/recovery:** Full mental practice schedule maintained when physical practice is impossible. Prevents skill degradation and motor memory decay.

2. **Volume extension:** When physical repetition limit is reached (fatigue, overuse risk), additional mental reps maintain training stimulus.

3. **High-stress pre-competition:** Mental practice rather than physical the day before competition — avoids fatigue while reinforcing execution.

4. **Between physical attempts:** "Micro-imagery" between physical practice trials (5-10 seconds of imagery before each attempt) combines with physical practice most efficiently.

5. **Technical refinement:** After identifying a technical flaw, imagery of the corrected movement can accelerate the motor pattern update.

### Frequency and Duration Guidelines

- **Session frequency:** 2-3 dedicated imagery sessions per week minimum for measurable improvement; daily is better during intensive preparation
- **Session duration:** 10-30 minutes. Beyond 30-40 minutes, cognitive fatigue reduces imagery quality.
- **Individual session structure:** Start short (5-10 min of high-quality imagery) and extend gradually as ability develops
- **Pre-performance micro-sessions:** 30 seconds to 5 minutes immediately before competition or before individual practice reps

### The "Twice the Practice" Principle

Practitioners often frame this for athletes as: "Mental practice means you train twice — once in the gym and once in your mind. Your nervous system doesn't fully distinguish them."

## 11. Athlete Assessment Before Starting Imagery Training

### Sport Imagery Ability Questionnaire (SIAQ)

Before beginning imagery training, sports psychologists assess the athlete's current imagery ability using the SIAQ (Cumming & Williams, 2012).

**Structure:** 15 items, 7-point Likert scale (1 = very hard to image, 7 = very easy to image)
**Five subscales:**
- Skill imagery ability
- Strategy imagery ability
- Goal imagery ability
- Affect (emotional) imagery ability
- Mastery imagery ability

**Uses:**
- Identify which imagery types are weak → target those in training
- Establish baseline → measure improvement over intervention
- Screen for athletes who will benefit most from LSRT (those with low baseline imagery ability)
- Track changes as imagery training progresses

**Practical outcome:** High scores on SIAQ predict greater effectiveness of subsequent imagery interventions. Low scorers benefit most from structured LSRT before being given independent imagery tasks.

## 12. Mental Periodization: When to Use Which Technique

### Off-Season / Preparatory Phase
- **Focus:** Skill acquisition, foundation building
- **Imagery type:** CS (specific skill) dominant; LSRT if imagery ability is weak
- **Goal:** Learn and encode new motor patterns; develop imagery ability itself
- **Session structure:** Longer sessions (20-30 min); practitioner-guided; high technical content
- **Frequency:** 3-5x per week

### Pre-Season / Late Preparation Phase
- **Focus:** Strategy, confidence, arousal management
- **Imagery type:** CG (cognitive general/strategy) + MG-M (mastery/confidence) + MG-A (arousal)
- **Goal:** Simulate competition conditions; build competitive readiness
- **Session structure:** Simulate full competition mental preparation routines; practice under induced pressure
- **Frequency:** Daily; begin integrating pre-competition routine structure

### In-Season / Competition Phase
- **Focus:** Consistency, execution, confidence maintenance
- **Imagery type:** MG-M + brief CS for technical cues; pre-competition routines dominant
- **Goal:** Prime performance state; maintain technique; manage setbacks quickly
- **Session structure:** Short (5-15 min); highly rehearsed scripts; automatic trigger routines
- **Frequency:** Before each competition + brief inter-session maintenance

### Post-Competition / Transition
- **Focus:** Review and reset
- **Imagery type:** MS (motivational specific) for future goals; brief MG-A processing
- **Goal:** Learn from performance; maintain motivation across transition
- **Session structure:** Replay best moments (positive reinforcement); briefly process errors then re-image correct execution

## Summary Table: Technique Selection Guide

| Goal | Technique | Perspective | Paivio Type | Duration |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Learn new skill | LSRT + CS imagery | External → Internal | CS | 15-20 min |
| Refine technique | PETTLEP + CS | Internal | CS | 10-15 min |
| Fix error pattern | AOMI (video + imagery) | External during AO, internal during MI | CS | 12-15 min |
| Build strategy | CG imagery | Either | CG | 5-10 min |
| Pre-competition confidence | MG-M + brief CS | Internal | MG-M | 10-15 min |
| Manage anxiety | MG-A + MG-M combined | Internal | MG-A + MG-M | 5-10 min |
| Motivation in training | MS imagery | External or internal | MS | 3-5 min |
| Very weak imagery ability | LSRT protocol | Start external | CS | 15-20 min, 4 consecutive days |
| Deepen physiological activation | Biofeedback + imagery | Internal | Any | 20-30 min |
