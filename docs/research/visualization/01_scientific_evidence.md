**Document type:** Research synthesis
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Scope:** Peer-reviewed evidence on types, mechanisms, populations, outcomes, and dose-response for mental imagery/visualization

---

## 1. Definitions and Taxonomy

Mental imagery (also called visualization, mental rehearsal, mental practice, or mental simulation) refers to the cognitive process of creating or recreating a sensory experience in the absence of the external stimulus. Multiple distinct types exist with separate evidence bases:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Motor imagery (MI)** | Imagining performing a physical movement or skill |
| **Process visualization** | Simulating the steps/process required to achieve a goal |
| **Outcome visualization** | Imagining the end-state or result of achieving a goal |
| **Guided imagery (GI)** | Therapist- or audio-directed imagery for relaxation, healing, or psychological outcomes |
| **Imagery rescripting (ImRs)** | Modifying distressing mental images to reduce their emotional impact (clinical) |
| **Imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT)** | Deliberately rehearsing rewritten nightmare scenarios (for PTSD/nightmares) |
| **Graded motor imagery (GMI)** | Staged program: laterality recognition → motor imagery → mirror therapy (pain rehabilitation) |
| **Functional imagery training (FIT)** | Motivational technique using personally relevant imagery to sustain goal-directed behavior |

## 2. Neuroscience Foundations

### 2.1 Functional Equivalence

The core neuroscience claim for motor imagery is **functional equivalence**: imagining a movement activates largely the same neural substrates as executing it.

**Evidence:**

- Neuroimaging (fMRI, PET) consistently shows activation of premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior and superior parietal lobules, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and prefrontal cortex during both motor imagery and motor execution. The overlap is substantial but not complete — descending motor output is suppressed during imagery. (Multiple fMRI studies; reviewed in Physio-pedia Mental Imagery in Sports)

- **TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) studies**: Subthreshold TMS applied over the motor cortex during motor imagery elicits motor evoked potentials (MEPs), demonstrating that corticospinal excitability increases significantly during imagery compared to rest. A key study (Fadiga et al., 1999, later replicated): "Focal enhancement of motor cortex excitability during motor imagery: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study" (PubMed PMID 11886355).

- Ranganathan et al. (2004) showed EEG signal increases in the supplementary motor area and contralateral sensorimotor areas after successful mental imagery training of elbow flexion — corresponding to the 13.5% strength gain observed behaviorally.

- An important caveat: The motor-cognitive model (Guillot, Collet) proposes a **functional dissociation** rather than complete equivalence, particularly regarding executive/monitoring processes. TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slowed motor imagery execution time but did not affect overt action — supporting the view that imagery also engages additional monitoring resources not required for physical action.

### 2.2 Mirror Neurons

The mirror neuron system (MNS) — first identified in macaque monkeys (Rizzolatti et al., 1992) — fires both when an animal performs an action and when it observes another doing so. In humans:

- Neuroimaging consistent with MNS activation has been found in inferior frontal gyrus (including Broca's area), medial frontal gyrus, insula, cingulate gyrus, and anterior parietal lobule during action observation and execution.
- **Critical limitation**: Electrophysiological single-unit recording (the gold standard for confirming mirror neuron properties) is not feasible in humans. Human studies rely on fMRI (indirect BOLD signal) and EEG/TMS. This limits certainty.
- A 2021 review (Heyes & Catmur, *Perspectives on Psychological Science*) challenged the prevailing interpretation, arguing that "mirror" activations may reflect motor imagery rather than a specialized observation system.
- A 2024 fMRI meta-analysis (*Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience*) examined two distinct mirror neuron pathways for social vs. non-social actions.

**Bottom line on mirror neurons**: The MNS likely contributes to action understanding and imitation learning, but its role as the primary mechanism for imagery-based performance gains remains contested. The functional equivalence evidence from TMS/fMRI is more directly relevant to imagery training effects.

### 2.3 Strength Gains via Mental Imagery (Brain-to-Muscle Pathway)

- **Yue & Cole (1992)**: 4-week mental training of imagined maximal contractions of the fifth finger abductor muscle produced a **22% strength increase** (vs. ~30% for actual physical training). Attributed to central programming changes.
- **Ranganathan et al. (2004)** (*Neuropsychologia*): Mental training of elbow flexion contractions produced a **13.5% strength gain** without any physical movement. The primary mechanism was identified as supraspinal (cortical) command enhancement.
- **Systematic review (Slimani et al., 2016, PMC4974856)**: 27 studies, 811 participants (595 healthy, 216 injured). Internal imagery outperformed external imagery for strength gains. Study durations: 2–12 weeks (healthy); 10 days–6 months (injured). Methodological quality averaged 5.92/10 (PEDro scale) — moderate.
- **Kinesthetic vs. visual imagery**: High mental effort yielded 20.5% strength gains vs. 2% for low mental effort. Internal (first-person kinesthetic) imagery induced more strength than external (third-person visual) imagery.

## 3. Types of Visualization — Evidence by Type

### 3.1 Motor Imagery / Mental Rehearsal (Sport and Physical Skills)

**The most extensively studied domain.**

#### Meta-Analytic Evidence

- **Driskell, Copper & Moran (1994)** (*Journal of Applied Psychology*): The foundational meta-analysis of 35 studies. Effect size: r = 0.255 (d ≈ 0.53, moderate). Calculated that optimal mental practice session duration ≈ **20.8 minutes**. Mental practice especially effective for cognitive-heavy tasks.

- **Hinshaw (1991)** (*Imagination, Cognition and Personality*): Earlier meta-analysis confirming positive effects of mental practice on motor skill performance.

- **Driskell et al. (2014 follow-up)** (*Journal of Applied Psychology*): Replication across 24 additional years of literature (1995–2018). Overall effect: **r = 0.131** (small but statistically significant). Importantly, effect size decreased when low-quality studies and subjective performance measures were excluded. Nine moderating factors examined: Practice Type, Expertise, Duration, Task Type, Control Type, Imagery Type, Performance Measure, Activity Type (individual vs. team), Setting.

- **Imagery interventions in sport (Simonsmeier et al., 2021, *Psychology of Sport and Exercise*)**: Meta-analysis including only RCTs in sport contexts. Confirmed positive effects but noted methodological concerns across studies.

- **Athletes' performance meta-analysis (PMC12109254, 2025)**: Multilevel meta-analysis with systematic review. Confirmed imagery practice augments athletic performance (basketball, gymnastics, tennis, soccer). Imagery lasting ~10 minutes, 3 times/week over ~100 days showed the most significant positive impact. Effect on athletes' mental health (confidence, anxiety reduction, self-efficacy) also demonstrated.

#### Sport-Specific Performance Gains

- **Fencing**: Visualization improved point control by +1.3 hits (25.5%). Less-experienced fencers improved point control by 39.0%; experienced fencers improved lunge distance by 12.8%.
- **Motor learning in children (RCTs, tennis)**: SMD = 1.05 for accuracy, SMD = 0.83 for stroke velocity, SMD = 1.87 for combined performance — but GRADE quality rating was "low" (PMC8465066, 2021, 22 studies, n=934).
- **Surgical skills (Arora et al., 2011, RCT)**: Surgical novices receiving mental rehearsal plus physical practice scored significantly higher on OSATS (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills) for simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Statistically significant differences in dexterity, visuospatial skills, and operative flow by Day 4.
- **Surgical education systematic review (Schmidt et al., 2025, *American Surgeon*)**: 12 studies reviewed. Clear advantages for mental practice in improving overall surgical performance. Mental rehearsal accelerates skill acquisition and is associated with neuroplastic changes.

#### Key Moderators

1. **Imagery ability**: Individuals with higher imagery vividness (measured by VVIQ, MIQ-3) generally benefit more. Athletes can be trained to improve imagery ability.
2. **Expertise**: Mental practice tends to benefit novices more for learning, experts more for refinement.
3. **Task type**: Cognitive/technical tasks (e.g., surgical procedures, gymnastics routines) show larger effects than simple reaction tasks.
4. **Combined with physical practice**: Mental imagery + physical practice consistently outperforms either alone. Mental imagery alone < physical practice alone < combined.
5. **Imagery perspective**: Task-dependent (see Section 4).

### 3.2 Process Visualization vs. Outcome Visualization

**Landmark study: Pham & Taylor (1999)**
- Published in: *Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin*, 25(2), 250–260.
- Population: College freshmen (n not specified in abstracts, typical for PSPB studies ~50–100).
- Design: 5–7 days before a midterm exam, participants were randomly assigned to: (a) process simulation (imagining good study habits), (b) outcome simulation (imagining getting a good grade), (c) control.
- **Results**: Process simulation group earned **significantly higher exam scores** 1 week later. Mediated by: enhanced planning, reduced anxiety, increased actual studying time.
- **Conclusion**: Visualizing the process (steps) was superior to visualizing the desired outcome. Outcome visualization may create a false sense of accomplished success, reducing motivation to act.

**Replication and extension (Taylor et al., subsequent work; UCLA Taylor Lab)**: Confirmed that mental simulation of the steps required to achieve a goal produces better goal achievement than simulating the end state. Mechanism: increased planning, identification of obstacles, reduced anxiety.

**Sports research**: Process goals (focusing on execution steps) vs. outcome goals (winning, scores) research consistently shows process goals reduce cognitive anxiety and improve performance regulation. A systematic review and meta-analysis on goal-setting in sport (*International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology*, 2022) confirmed this pattern.

**Practical implication**: For skill acquisition, problem-solving, and anxiety management, **process visualization has a stronger evidence base** than outcome visualization. Outcome visualization has weak or null evidence for performance improvement.

### 3.3 PETTLEP Model (Functional Equivalence Framework)

Developed by **Holmes & Collins (2001)**, *Journal of Applied Sport Psychology*, 13(1), 60–83. PETTLEP is an acronym defining seven components for high-quality imagery:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **P**hysical | Replicate physical aspects (posture, muscle tension, equipment held) |
| **E**nvironment | Image in the actual performance environment (or highly similar) |
| **T**ask | Include correct body/eye movements, relevant sensations, heart rate |
| **T**iming | Real time (not slow motion) |
| **L**earning | Modify imagery as skill advances |
| **E**motion | Include appropriate emotional arousal (without excessive anxiety) |
| **P**erspective | First-person preferred for most tasks; third-person for form-based tasks |

**Theoretical basis**: The brain stores motor programs as central representations activated by both physical execution and motor imagery of that execution. More realistic imagery (higher PETTLEP fidelity) → greater functional equivalence → greater performance transfer.

**Evidence for PETTLEP:**
- Systematic review (*Applied Sciences*, 2022, 12(19), 9753): 30+ studies reviewed. PETTLEP-based imagery was effective for enhancing sport performance, especially combined with physical practice and compared to traditional imagery.
- RCT (basketball shooting, 2022, *Psychology of Sport and Exercise*): Dispositional mindfulness interacted with PETTLEP imagery training on mid-range shooting performance — high-mindfulness participants showed significantly greater imagery benefits.
- "Twenty years of PETTLEP imagery: An update" (*Psychology of Sport and Exercise*, 2022): Notes PETTLEP does not consistently support long-term improvements over simpler imagery approaches in all studies. Motivational functional imagery training (FIT) produces more sustained improvements.
- **Youth soccer players**: PETTLEP imagery did not enhance performance in this population — suggesting age and prior experience moderate effectiveness.
- **Goalkeeper penalty anticipation**: PETTLEP improved spatial anticipation.

**Limitations**: PETTLEP evidence base is mixed. Higher methodological quality studies show smaller effects. The model requires full context simulation which is practically demanding.

### 3.4 Guided Imagery (Anxiety, Stress, Clinical Populations)

**Definition**: Structured imagery led by a therapist or audio guide, typically to induce relaxation, reduce anxiety, or support healing. Not purely motor imagery — engages imaginal narrative scenes.

**Evidence:**

- **Guided imagery for anxiety disorder (PMC10871407, 2023)**: RCT, n=20 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. Experimental group: pharmacotherapy + 10 sessions of 30–40 min GI (nature-based imagery + deep breathing). Control: pharmacotherapy alone. **Result**: Significant improvement in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) scores (Z = 2.86, p < 0.01) and psychological quality of life (Z = 3.31, p < 0.01). Limitation: small n=10 per group, single-center.

- **Cervical cancer patients (PMC10561422, 2023)**: RCT on guided imagery relaxation for anxiety. Significant anxiety reduction in experimental group.

- **EEG brain function (MDPI Sensors, 2023, PMC10346678)**: Randomized trial (GI group n=20 vs. mental task group n=28). GI group showed significantly higher alpha wave power — associated with improved attentional control and reduced stress.

- **Systematic review narrative (ResearchGate, 2025)**: Numerous RCTs show guided imagery dramatically lowers stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms across demographics. Note: evidence on immune function is promising but conflicting — RCTs needed.

- **Meta-analysis of guided imagery (DARE review, NBK70988)**: Found positive effects on outcomes, but noted heterogeneity and methodological limitations in included studies.

- **Chronic back pain (ScienceDirect, 2023)**: A-B design, n=35 women, Rheumatology clinic. Six GI exercises practiced at least once daily. Hypothesized (and partially confirmed) reductions in pain, anxiety, and fear-avoidance scores.

### 3.5 Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) — PTSD and Nightmares

**Strongest clinical evidence for a specific imagery technique.**

**What it is**: Patients with recurrent distressing nightmares (commonly PTSD-related) rewrite the nightmare narrative while awake, then mentally rehearse the new version before sleep. Developed by Krakow and colleagues; originated from early work by Marks (1967).

**Meta-analysis (Casement & Swanson, 2012, PMC4120639)**:
- 13 studies, n=511 participants
- 5 RCTs; 1 active treatment control
- Populations: civilians (n=286), military veterans (n=214), active duty (n=11); 86% with PTSD
- **Effect sizes (within-group)**:
  - Nightmare frequency: ES = 0.69 (large)
  - Sleep quality: ES = 0.68 (large)
  - PTSD symptoms: ES = 0.72 (large)
- Between-group comparisons: moderate to large (0.59–0.67)
- Benefits sustained through 6–12 month follow-up

**Specific military data**: In soldiers returning from Iraq, IRT reduced nightmare frequency by **44%** at 1-month follow-up; 64% of soldiers reported significant relief; PTSD symptoms decreased by **41%** and **34%** on respective measures.

**Enhanced IRT**: Adding targeted memory reactivation (Hein et al., 2023, *Current Biology*) enhanced IRT effectiveness further.

**Clinical status**: IRT is considered empirically supported and is included in clinical guidelines for nightmare disorder.

---

### 3.6 Imagery Rescripting (ImRs) — Clinical Applications

**What it is**: Modifying the content of distressing intrusive memories or images to change their emotional meaning and reduce their impact. Used in CBT for PTSD, social anxiety, depression, eating disorders, OCD.

**Meta-analysis (Morina et al., 2017; updated Arntz, 2023, *Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry*)**:
- 17 RCTs, n=908 (417 in ImRs condition)
- Overall effect vs. passive controls (waitlist): **g = 0.68** (moderate-large)
- Effect vs. active comparators (prolonged exposure, cognitive restructuring, EMDR): non-significant — ImRs performs as well as established treatments but not better
- Long-term effects sustained at follow-up
- Disorders treated: PTSD, social anxiety, depression, bulimia nervosa, borderline personality disorder, OCD, health anxiety, GAD, nightmare disorder, test anxiety

**Depression-specific**: Large effect sizes for imagery rescripting in treating depression; comparable to cognitive restructuring (Lancet Psychiatry, 2021 review by Holmes et al.).

**Social anxiety disorder**: Imagery-enhanced CBT vs. verbal CBT — RCT evidence (Cambridge University Press, *Psychological Medicine*) supports imagery enhancement, as negative self-imagery is a key maintaining factor in SAD.

---

### 3.7 Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) — Pain Rehabilitation

**What it is**: Three-stage program for chronic pain (especially CRPS):
1. Laterality recognition (left/right discrimination of body parts)
2. Motor imagery (imagining moving affected limb)
3. Mirror therapy (watching mirror reflection of unaffected limb)

**Key researcher**: Lorimer Moseley (NOIgroup).

**Moseley's landmark RCT (2004, *Pain*)**: CRPS Type 1 patients receiving GMI showed **20-point reduction on the Neuropathic Pain Scale** — statistically and clinically significant. 2005 replication confirmed that GMI outperformed conventional pharmacological treatments in pain reduction.

**Systematic review (Mendez-Rebolledo et al., 2017, *Journal of Back and Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation*)**: GMI and mirror therapy can improve pain in CRPS Type 1. GMI showed greater improvement in **functional outcomes**; mirror therapy more effective for **swelling reduction**. Limitation: insufficient evidence to recommend over other treatments due to small sample sizes and population heterogeneity.

**2024 review (MDPI Biomedicines)**: GMI combined with mirror therapy shows average pain reduction of ~20 NPS points and significant functional capacity improvement in CRPS.

**Mechanism**: GMI corrects distorted cortical representations of the affected limb (cortical remapping) that maintain CRPS symptoms.

---

### 3.8 Mental Imagery for Strength (Non-Athletic Populations)

Already covered in Section 2.3 (Yue & Cole 1992; Ranganathan 2004). Additional data:

- **Injury/immobilization**: Mental imagery during limb immobilization significantly reduces strength loss versus control (multiple studies in the PMC4974856 systematic review). Clinically relevant for post-surgical recovery.
- **ACL rehabilitation**: MI interventions successfully reduced strength loss during ACL rehabilitation.
- **Physical-to-mental ratio**: Strength gains from motor imagery + physical practice combinations:
  - 100% physical: ~100% of achievable gains
  - Mixed physical + mental: comparable to physical-only or superior in some protocols
  - 100% mental only: ~13–22% of gains achievable by physical training alone

## 4. Perspective: Internal vs. External Imagery

A critical moderator for effectiveness.

| Perspective | Description | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Internal (first-person)** | Seeing/feeling from inside own body | Kinesthetic tasks, closed skills already learned, experienced athletes |
| **External (third-person)** | Watching self perform from outside | Form-based tasks (gymnastics, diving), novel skill learning, technique correction |

**Evidence:**
- External imagery significantly more effective than internal for learning new karate kata and gymnastics floor routines.
- Internal imagery superior for penalty kicks (soccer) and other closed-skill tasks in experienced athletes.
- **Individual preference matters**: Preferred perspective → more vivid, more controllable imagery → greater benefit. Flexibility between perspectives is the ideal state.
- **Skill level interaction**: Internal imagery requires internalized motor program. Novices who haven't yet formed the motor representation benefit more from external (observational) imagery.

---

## 5. Dose-Response: How Much Visualization Is Needed?

This is an **under-researched** area with no clear consensus. Key data points:

### Session Duration
- **Driskell et al. (1994)** calculated optimal mental practice session duration = **~20.8 minutes**
- Basketball free-throw studies: 13-minute and 18-minute conditions more effective than 8-minute; 13-minute condition was most effective (diminishing returns at 18 minutes)
- Surgical mental rehearsal: 25-minute instructor-led initial session + 15-minute daily self-driven sessions (one protocol); or 30-minute psychologist-led sessions
- Guided imagery for anxiety: 30–40 minute sessions (clinical context)
- Sport: ~10 minutes per session was identified as optimal in one multilevel meta-analysis (PMC12109254)

### Session Frequency
- Most effective frequency in sports: **3–4 sessions per week** (experimentally tested at 3, 4, 5/week across 4-week protocols)
- Frequency is a **stronger predictor of benefit than duration**
- PTSD nightmare work (IRT): Daily practice of rewritten nightmare scenario before sleep
- Motor imagery for strength: Studies ranged from daily to 5x/week over 2–12 weeks

### Duration of Training Program
- Most sport studies: 4–12 weeks
- Significant effects found after **3 weeks** of MI (at least 2x/week) in stroke motor recovery
- Imagery dosage associated with best outcome in sports: **~10 min × 3/week × 100 days** (Frontiers Psychology meta-analysis, 2025)
- Short interventions (single session): Can produce acute performance improvements, especially for well-learned skills

### Dose-Response Research
- **"Examining frequency in the imagery dose-response relationship"** (*Psychology of Sport and Exercise*, 2022): Systematically varied frequency; found frequency matters more than total volume per session
- **"Examining duration in the imagery dose-response relationship"** (de Gruyter, 2023): Tested 8 vs. 13 vs. 18 minutes; non-linear relationship with diminishing returns beyond optimal point

| Slimani et al. (2016) | Varied | Mental imagery + physical vs. physical alone | MI combination superior |

---

## 8. Evidence Quality Assessment

| Type | Quality of Evidence | Strongest Evidence |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Motor imagery (sport) | Moderate | Meta-analyses confirm small-moderate effects |
| IRT for PTSD nightmares | Moderate-strong | 13 studies, large within-group ES; only 5 RCTs |
| Imagery rescripting (clinical) | Moderate | 17 RCTs, g = 0.68 vs. passive control |
| Process vs. outcome visualization | Moderate | Pham & Taylor (1999) is foundational; needs replication |
| PETTLEP model | Low-moderate | Mostly small RCTs, mixed results |
| Guided imagery (anxiety) | Low-moderate | Small sample RCTs; heterogeneous protocols |
| Mental imagery for strength | Moderate | Multiple labs replicated; mechanism identified |
| GMI for CRPS | Low-moderate | Small samples; significant pain reductions |
| Aphantasia / low imagery ability | Preliminary | Functional alternatives exist; emerging research |

**Consistent methodological weaknesses across the field:**
- Small sample sizes
- Heterogeneous outcome measures
- Difficulty blinding participants
- Short intervention periods
- Reliance on subjective performance measures inflates effect sizes
- Publication bias likely (positive results over-represented)

## 9. What Works and For Whom — Summary

### Highest-Confidence Recommendations

1. **Motor imagery + physical practice combined**: For skill acquisition in sport, surgery, rehabilitation — consistently superior to physical practice alone. Low risk, positive benefit.

2. **Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) for PTSD nightmares**: Strong effect sizes, sustained at follow-up, empirically validated. Should be considered first-line for nightmare disorder in PTSD.

3. **Imagery rescripting (ImRs) for clinical conditions**: Well-evidenced for social anxiety, PTSD, depression, eating disorders. Comparable to established CBT techniques.

4. **Process visualization over outcome visualization**: When the goal is performance improvement or anxiety management — simulate the steps, not the result.

5. **Mental imagery for injury rehabilitation**: Imagery training preserves strength during immobilization and accelerates return-to-performance.

### Moderate-Confidence Recommendations

6. **PETTLEP model**: More realistic imagery (higher fidelity to actual performance environment/body state) produces better outcomes than generic visualization — but the extra complexity may not always be worth it vs. simpler protocols.

7. **Guided imagery for anxiety and stress**: Beneficial as adjunct to standard care; not strong enough as standalone for clinical anxiety disorders.

8. **Graded motor imagery for CRPS**: Reduces pain, improves function; small evidence base but few alternatives with comparable effect sizes.

### Lower-Confidence / Emerging

9. **Mental imagery for musicians**: Promising for performance anxiety but RCT evidence is sparse and methodologically weak.

10. **Positive imagery for depression/anhedonia**: Theoretically strong (Lancet Psychiatry review), early RCT support, but not yet a standalone validated treatment.
