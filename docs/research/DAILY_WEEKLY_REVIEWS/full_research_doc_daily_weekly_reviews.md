# Daily & Weekly Review Research Document
**Status:** Research Complete (Expanded)
**Updated:** 06-02-2026
**Version:** 4.0 — Added motivation type variations (#31) covering McClelland's motivation types, approach/avoidance, mastery/performance goals, passion types, curiosity, self-concordance
**Research Domains:** 31 (20 original + 6 from v2.0 + 4 from v3.0 + 1 from v4.0)
**Companion to:** `docs/research/FIELD_REPORTS/full_research_doc_field_reports.md`

## Objective
Design the optimal daily and weekly review system grounded in science and best practice. This complements the field report system (per-session, micro-level reflection) with higher-level review methodology (daily/weekly cadence) focused on pattern recognition, trajectory checking, and strategic adjustment.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Field reports** = per-session, "what happened in this interaction"
- **Daily reviews** = end-of-day processing, emotional closure, quick capture
- **Weekly reviews** = meta-level pattern recognition, "am I heading where I want to go?"

## Research Findings

### 1. Stoic Daily Reflection Practices

**Sources:** Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* (c. 170 CE); Seneca, *On Anger* III.36 and *Letters to Lucilius*; Epictetus, *Discourses* III.10; Robertson, D. (2019) *How to Think Like a Roman Emperor*; Pigliucci, M. (2017) *How to Be a Stoic*.

#### Key Findings

**The dual-review model (AM/PM):**
- **Morning priming** (Marcus Aurelius): Review what lies ahead, set intentions, mentally rehearse challenges. "When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant..."
- **Evening audit** (Seneca): "I examine my entire day and go back over what I've done and said, hiding nothing from myself and passing nothing by." Three questions: What bad habit have I cured today? What weakness have I resisted? In what way am I better?

**The dichotomy of control** (Epictetus): Divide events into what is "up to us" (our judgments, intentions, actions) vs. "not up to us" (others' reactions, outcomes). Review only what is within your control.

**The "View from Above"**: Zoom out from individual events to see the larger pattern. Marcus practiced this as a perspective-taking exercise during reflection.

#### Frameworks
- **Morning:** Premeditatio malorum (premeditation of adversity) + intention-setting
- **Evening:** Three Seneca questions + dichotomy of control sorting

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- The AM/PM split is powerful: morning = intention-setting, evening = processing/learning
- Always separate "what I controlled" from "what happened to me" in review prompts
- The "View from Above" maps to the weekly review's purpose: zoom out from individual sessions to see trajectory
- Negative visualization (premeditatio) as a pre-mortem tool: "What could go wrong today, and how will I handle it?"

### 2. Positive Psychology: Evidence-Based Daily Practices

**Sources:** Seligman et al. (2005) "Positive Psychology Progress," *American Psychologist*; Emmons & McCullough (2003) "Counting Blessings vs. Burdens," *JPSP*; Seligman et al. (2005) "Three Good Things" RCT; Lyubomirsky et al. (2005) meta-analysis on well-being interventions; Peterson & Seligman (2004) *Character Strengths and Virtues*.

#### Key Findings

**Three Good Things exercise:**
- RCT data: Writing 3 good things + why they happened each night for 1 week produced significant happiness increases and depression decreases lasting 6 months (d = 0.3-0.5). One of the most replicated findings in positive psychology.
- The "why" component is critical -- it activates causal attribution and self-efficacy ("I contributed to this good thing").

**Savoring interventions:**
- Fred Bryant's savoring research shows that actively attending to, appreciating, and enhancing positive experiences boosts their emotional impact. Simply noting "what went well" is less effective than *reliving the sensory details*.

**Character strengths spotting:**
- Peterson & Seligman's VIA framework: identifying which of your top strengths you used today. Research shows daily strengths use correlates with greater well-being and engagement.

**PERMA model** (Seligman, 2011):
- P = Positive emotions, E = Engagement, R = Relationships, M = Meaning, A = Achievement
- A daily/weekly check-in can assess all five dimensions as a holistic well-being audit.

**Critical caveat from meta-analyses:**
- Gratitude journaling effect sizes are more modest than popularized: d ~ 0.31 for well-being, d ~ 0.12 for depression (Dickens, 2017). Much of the effect disappears when compared to *active* control groups rather than no-treatment controls.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- "Three Good Things + Why" is the single most validated daily micro-practice. Include it but don't make it the centerpiece
- The "why" follow-up transforms gratitude from passive noting to active agency-building
- Pair positive recall with strengths identification: "What went well AND what strength did you use?"
- PERMA provides a weekly check-in framework for holistic assessment
- Do not over-rely on gratitude -- self-efficacy reflection ("what did I do well and why") has stronger theoretical support

### 3. Productivity Systems: GTD Weekly Review & Others

**Sources:** Allen, D. (2001, 2015) *Getting Things Done*; Carroll, R. (2018) *The Bullet Journal Method*; Newport, C. (2016) *Deep Work*; Covey, S. (1989) *7 Habits* (Weekly Planning).

#### Key Findings

**GTD Weekly Review -- 3 phases:**
1. **Get Clear**: Collect loose papers, process inbox, empty your head (brain dump)
2. **Get Current**: Review action lists, calendar, waiting-for items, project lists. Update everything.
3. **Get Creative**: Review someday/maybe list, brainstorm new ideas, set priorities for next week

Allen calls this "the critical success factor" of the entire GTD system. Without the weekly review, the system degrades within 2-3 weeks.

**Bullet Journal weekly migration:**
- At week's end, review all incomplete tasks. For each: migrate forward (still relevant), schedule (specific date), or strike (no longer relevant). The act of *manually rewriting* forces prioritization.

**Key insight across all systems:**
- Separation of capture from processing. Daily = capture. Weekly = process, organize, decide.
- The weekly review is not about doing work -- it's about *deciding what work to do*.
- Time-boxing matters: GTD suggests 60-90 min; for personal use, 30 min is sufficient.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- The "Get Clear, Get Current, Get Creative" flow is an excellent macro-structure for weekly reviews
- Brain dump / "empty your head" as a first step prevents the review from being hijacked by whatever is most salient
- Weekly migration (re-choosing what matters) prevents stale goals from persisting
- Keep capture and processing as separate activities and separate UI flows

### 4. Sports Science: Periodization & Training Block Reviews

**Sources:** Bompa & Haff (2009) *Periodization*; Banister et al. (1975) fitness-fatigue model; Foster (1998) session-RPE; Gabbett (2016) acute:chronic workload ratio; Kellmann (2010) *Recovery-Stress Questionnaire*.

#### Key Findings

**Periodization structure:**
- Microcycle (1 week), Mesocycle (3-6 weeks), Macrocycle (months-year)
- Each level has its own review cadence and focus
- Weekly reviews assess the microcycle; monthly reviews assess the mesocycle

**Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR):**
- Compares this week's load to the 4-week rolling average. Ratio of 0.8-1.3 is the "sweet spot" for adaptation without injury. Below 0.8 = detraining. Above 1.5 = injury risk spike.
- Directly applicable: compare this week's volume/intensity to the monthly average. Spikes or crashes are warning signs.

**Deload weeks:**
- Every 3-4 weeks of progressive overload should be followed by a lighter week (50-70% of normal load). This allows adaptation and prevents burnout/overtraining.
- Weekly review should assess: "Am I due for a deload?"

**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) tracking:**
- Session RPE (Foster method): After each session, rate effort 1-10 and multiply by duration. Gives a single "training load" number. Aggregated weekly for load management.

**Recovery-stress balance:**
- Kellmann's RESTQ measures both stress AND recovery. High stress without high recovery = burnout risk. The weekly review should assess both sides.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Weekly reviews should compare current week to rolling 4-week average (not just last week)
- Build in deload/rest week awareness: every 3-4 weeks, prompt lighter goals
- Track both load AND recovery/wellbeing to detect burnout early
- RPE-style ratings (effort per session) provide simple load monitoring
- The periodization concept applies: users should be in phases (volume-building, skill-focus, consolidation, rest)

### 5. CBT & DBT: Structured Daily Self-Monitoring

**Sources:** Linehan (1993) *Skills Training Manual for BPD*; Beck (1979) *Cognitive Therapy of Depression*; Craske (2010) *Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy*; Chapman (2006) DBT diary card research.

#### Key Findings

**DBT Diary Cards -- the gold standard of daily monitoring:**
- Completed DAILY, reviewed WEEKLY with therapist
- Track: emotions (rated 0-5), urges (rated 0-5), specific target behaviors (yes/no), skills used
- The card creates a data stream that makes weekly patterns visible
- Key design: minimal daily effort (2-3 min, mostly checkboxes and ratings), rich weekly analysis

**CBT Behavioral Activation scheduling:**
- Schedule activities in advance, then rate actual mood/mastery after completion
- The discrepancy between predicted and actual experience is the learning signal
- People consistently underpredict enjoyment of activities they're avoiding

**The ABC model (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence):**
- For each significant event: What triggered it? What did you do? What resulted?
- Weekly review: look for patterns in antecedents (recurring triggers) and consequences (what's being reinforced)

**Key clinical insight:**
- Daily tracking that is too demanding gets abandoned. DBT diary cards survive because they're mostly pre-structured (checkboxes, scales) with minimal free text.
- The WEEKLY review is where insight happens. The daily card is just data collection.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Daily = data collection (ratings, checkboxes, quick capture). Weekly = analysis and insight
- Pre-structured inputs (scales, toggles, chips) dramatically outperform free text for daily compliance
- Track emotions AND behaviors -- the connection between them is where the insight lives
- The DBT model of "daily capture + weekly pattern review" is one of the most clinically validated review structures in existence
- Include predicted vs. actual experience tracking to combat avoidance

### 6. Neuroscience: Memory Consolidation & the Role of Review

**Sources:** Walker (2017) *Why We Sleep*; Roediger & Karpicke (2006) testing effect; Cepeda et al. (2006) spacing effect meta-analysis; Nader et al. (2000) memory reconsolidation; Stickgold (2005) hippocampal replay.

#### Key Findings

**Hippocampal replay during sleep:**
- The hippocampus replays the day's experiences during slow-wave sleep, transferring them to long-term cortical storage. Reviewing experiences before sleep may "tag" them for priority consolidation.
- This provides a neurological basis for evening review: you are literally priming what your brain consolidates overnight.

**The testing/retrieval effect:**
- Actively recalling information strengthens memory traces far more than passive re-exposure (d = 0.50-0.80). Simply asking "what happened today?" activates retrieval, which strengthens the memory.
- The review's primary mechanism may be retrieval practice, not just reflection.

**The spacing effect:**
- Distributed review (spaced over time) produces dramatically better long-term retention than massed review. Reviewing daily events at end-of-day, then again in a weekly review, creates two spaced retrieval events.
- The daily + weekly cadence is neurologically optimal for memory consolidation.

**Memory reconsolidation:**
- When a memory is retrieved, it becomes temporarily malleable and must be "reconsolidated." This means reviewing an experience *can change the memory* -- for better or worse. Structured review with new perspective can rewrite the emotional tone of a memory.

**Zeigarnik effect:**
- Incomplete tasks persist in working memory, causing intrusive thoughts. An evening review that "closes" the day's open loops reduces cognitive load and improves sleep (Scullin et al., 2018: writing a to-do list before bed reduced sleep onset latency by 9 minutes).

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Evening review before sleep leverages hippocampal consolidation -- the brain prioritizes what was recently reviewed
- The act of recalling ("what happened today?") IS the intervention -- retrieval practice strengthens learning
- Daily + weekly = two spaced retrieval events, neurologically optimal
- Review can reshape memories through reconsolidation -- framing matters enormously
- Evening "brain dump" / closure reduces intrusive thoughts and improves sleep

### 7. Behavioral Economics: How We Remember Days & Weeks

**Sources:** Kahneman (2011) *Thinking, Fast and Slow*; Kahneman et al. (1993) peak-end rule; Fredrickson & Kahneman (1993) duration neglect; Tversky & Kahneman (1974) anchoring; Baumeister et al. (2001) negativity bias.

#### Key Findings

**Peak-end rule:**
- People judge an experience primarily by its most intense moment (peak) and how it ended. The average quality of the experience and its duration have surprisingly little impact on remembered experience.
- A week with one great moment + a good Friday will be remembered as a "good week" even if Tuesday-Thursday were mediocre.

**Duration neglect:**
- The length of an experience barely affects how it's remembered. A 2-hour bad session and a 20-minute bad session feel equally bad in memory. This means weekly reviews shouldn't weight experiences by duration.

**The experiencing self vs. remembering self:**
- Your moment-to-moment experience (experiencing self) and your memory of that experience (remembering self) are different. Reviews access the remembering self, which is subject to systematic biases.
- Data from daily tracking (closer to the experiencing self) can anchor the remembering self's distortions.

**Negativity bias (Baumeister et al., 2001):**
- "Bad is stronger than good." Negative events have roughly 3x the psychological impact of equivalent positive events. One harsh rejection will overwrite five pleasant conversations in memory.
- Reviews must actively counteract this: explicitly prompt for positive experiences, not just "what happened."

**Anchoring effect:**
- The first piece of information encountered heavily influences subsequent judgments. If the review starts with "what went wrong?", the entire review is anchored negatively. Starting with data or achievements anchors more accurately.

**Focusing illusion:**
- "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it." Whatever the review directs attention to feels disproportionately important. Design review prompts carefully -- they determine what feels important.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Start reviews with data/facts (anchoring), not with "how do you feel?" (which activates biased recall)
- Explicitly prompt for mid-week and average experiences, not just peaks and endings
- Counter negativity bias: prompt for positives BEFORE negatives (3:1 ratio reflects the bias)
- Use daily tracking data to anchor the weekly review -- the data corrects the remembering self's distortions
- End reviews on a forward-looking, positive note (peak-end rule: the ending colors the memory of the entire review)
- Design prompts with the focusing illusion in mind: what you ask about becomes disproportionately salient

### 8. Narrative Psychology & Life Story Research

**Sources:** McAdams (2001) "The Psychology of Life Stories," *Review of General Psychology*; Pennebaker (1997) expressive writing research; Wilson (2011) *Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change*; McLean et al. (2007) narrative identity development.

#### Key Findings

**Narrative identity (McAdams):**
- People construct their identity through the stories they tell about their lives. These narratives are not neutral records -- they shape motivation, self-concept, and future behavior.
- Two key narrative types: **Redemption sequences** (bad things lead to good outcomes -- "I struggled but grew") predict higher well-being. **Contamination sequences** (good things ruined by bad outcomes -- "Things were going well but then...") predict depression.

**Story editing (Wilson):**
- Small prompts can shift how people narrate their experiences, which changes future behavior. In one study, freshmen who were prompted to reframe academic struggles as normal and temporary had higher GPAs and lower dropout rates.
- The weekly review is a "story editing" opportunity: the prompts determine whether the user builds a redemption or contamination narrative.

**Narrative coherence:**
- Stories that are coherent (have causal connections, temporal structure, and thematic consistency) are associated with better psychological adjustment. Helping users construct coherent narratives from their week's experiences is inherently therapeutic.

**The "chapter" model:**
- McAdams found people naturally organize life into chapters. A weekly review can leverage this: "What chapter are you in?" creates a narrative arc that gives meaning to individual events.

**Pennebaker's LIWC findings:**
- The most beneficial writing shows increasing use of causal words (because, reason) and insight words (understand, realize) across sessions. This indicates narrative construction -- moving from "what happened" to "why" to "what it means."

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Weekly reviews should help users build redemption narratives: "What was hard, and what did it lead to?"
- Prompt for causal reasoning ("why") and insight ("what does this mean?"), not just event recall
- Avoid prompts that invite contamination sequences ("What went wrong?" without a growth follow-up)
- The "chapter" framing gives long-term context: weekly reviews build a story arc, not just a data log
- Over time, the review system creates a searchable personal narrative -- this is inherently valuable for identity development

### 9. Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

**Sources:** Deci & Ryan (2000) "The 'What' and 'Why' of Goal Pursuits," *Psychological Inquiry*; Ryan & Deci (2017) *Self-Determination Theory*; Vansteenkiste & Ryan (2013) on need-supportive environments.

#### Key Findings

**Three basic psychological needs:**
1. **Autonomy**: Feeling that one's actions are self-endorsed, not externally controlled
2. **Competence**: Feeling effective, experiencing mastery and growth
3. **Relatedness**: Feeling connected to others, belonging

When all three needs are satisfied, intrinsic motivation flourishes. When any is frustrated, motivation declines and well-being suffers.

**Applied to review system design:**
- **Autonomy-supportive**: User chooses what to review, which fields to complete, when to do it. The system suggests, never mandates. Avoid language of obligation ("you should," "you need to").
- **Competence-building**: Show progress, highlight improvement, make skill development visible. Avoid overwhelming comparisons or impossible standards.
- **Relatedness-preserving**: Connect the review to personal values and relationships. "Who did you connect with?" not just "How many approaches?"

**Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation:**
- External rewards (badges, points, streaks) can undermine intrinsic motivation (the "overjustification effect"). People who journal for badges may stop when badges lose novelty. People who journal because they find it genuinely useful continue.
- Gamification is a double-edged sword: it boosts short-term engagement but can erode long-term intrinsic motivation.

**Autonomy-supportive language:**
- "You might consider..." vs. "You should..."
- "What matters to you?" vs. "Here's what you need to focus on"
- "Would you like to explore...?" vs. "Complete the following..."

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- The review must FEEL like a tool the user controls, not a system that controls them
- Minimize mandatory fields; maximize optional depth. The user should never feel coerced
- Show competence: progress visualizations, "you've improved since..." comparisons
- Use autonomy-supportive language throughout all prompts
- Be cautious with gamification: streaks and badges risk undermining intrinsic motivation
- Include relatedness: "Who supported you?" / "Who did you connect with?" as review dimensions

### 10. Flow Research: Daily/Weekly Flow Tracking

**Sources:** Csikszentmihalyi (1990) *Flow*; Csikszentmihalyi & Larson (1987) Experience Sampling Method; Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi (2002) flow conditions; Jackson & Eklund (2002) Flow State Scale.

#### Key Findings

**Flow conditions:**
1. Clear goals for the activity
2. Immediate feedback
3. Balance between challenge and skill (the "flow channel")
4. Merging of action and awareness
5. Loss of self-consciousness
6. Altered sense of time
7. Autotelic experience (intrinsically rewarding)

**Challenge-skill balance:**
- If challenge >> skill: anxiety
- If skill >> challenge: boredom
- Sweet spot: challenge slightly exceeds current skill level
- Weekly tracking of "when did I feel in flow?" reveals optimal challenge zones

**Experience Sampling Method (ESM):**
- Random prompts throughout the day asking "What are you doing? How do you feel?" This captures the experiencing self in real-time, avoiding retrospective bias.
- Relevant: daily micro-check-ins capture closer-to-real-time data than end-of-week recall.

**Flow frequency as wellbeing predictor:**
- People who experience flow more frequently report higher life satisfaction, regardless of what the flow activity is. Tracking flow moments and their conditions reveals what enables peak experience.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Daily: "When today did you feel most engaged/alive/in the zone?" -- identifies flow moments
- Weekly: Pattern analysis -- what conditions (time of day, type of activity, emotional state) predict flow?
- Track challenge-skill balance: "Was today's challenge level about right, too easy, or too hard?"
- If users consistently report no flow, the challenge level may need adjustment (too easy or too hard)
- Flow tracking naturally motivates: people want to recreate flow conditions

### 11. Coaching Models: GROW, Wheel of Life, Inner Game, SFBT

**Sources:** Whitmore (2017) *Coaching for Performance* 5th ed; Gallwey (1974) *The Inner Game of Tennis*; de Shazer (1988) *Clues*; De Jong & Berg (2012) *Interviewing for Solutions* 4th ed; Grant (2003) self-coaching study, University of Sydney.

#### Key Findings

**GROW Model (Whitmore):**
- **G**oal: What do you want? (Review last week's goal + set this week's)
- **R**eality: What is actually happening? (Honest, non-judgmental assessment)
- **O**ptions: What could you do? (Generate minimum 3 alternatives)
- **W**ill: What will you commit to? (Specific action + commitment rating 1-10; if <8, revise)
- Meta-analysis (Theeboom et al., 2014): coaching produced significant effects on goal-directed self-regulation (d = 0.74).

**SFBT Scaling Questions (de Shazer & Berg):**
- "On a scale of 1-10, where are you?" -> "What tells you you're at a [X] and not a 0?" (surfaces strengths) -> "What would one point higher look like?" (creates micro-goals) -> "When were you at that higher level?" (finds past solutions)
- The "What keeps you from being lower?" question is the most powerful -- it forces recognition of existing competence.

**Inner Game (Gallwey):**
- Performance = Potential - Interference. The goal is reducing Self 1 (inner critic) interference, not adding more instruction.
- Non-judgmental awareness: "What did you notice?" not "How did you do?"
- Self 1 identification: "What was your inner critic saying?" -- tracking this over time reveals interference patterns.
- Focus of attention technique: "This week I'm paying attention to [X]" -- simpler and less pressured than behavior goals.

**Self-coaching effectiveness (Grant, 2003):**
- Structured self-coaching captures ~80% of external coaching benefit. The gap is in accountability and blind spot identification.
- Written format outperforms mental reflection. Questions outperform instructions. Consistency beats intensity (weekly 15-min > monthly 90-min).

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- GROW provides the macro-structure for weekly reviews: assess goal, check reality, generate options, commit
- SFBT scaling (1-10 + "what's working" + "one point higher") should be a core mechanic -- simple, fast, evidence-based, non-judgmental
- The Inner Game's non-judgmental framing is essential: "What did you notice?" not "How well did you do?"
- Track "inner critic patterns" over time -- what Self 1 keeps saying reveals deeper interference
- The commitment scale (1-10, revise if <8) is a powerful self-accountability tool
- Questions, not instructions, are the primary interaction mechanism

### 12. Quantified Self & Personal Analytics

**Sources:** Wolf (2010) "The Data-Driven Life," *NYT Magazine*; Harkin et al. (2016) self-monitoring meta-analysis (138 studies); Etkin (2016) "Hidden Cost of Quantification," *JCR*; Few (2006) *Information Dashboard Design*; Tufte (1983) *Visual Display of Quantitative Information*.

#### Key Findings

**Self-monitoring effect:**
- Harkin et al. (2016) meta-analysis: monitoring goal progress improves attainment (d ~ 0.4). The effect is strongest when data is recorded physically and reviewed frequently.
- The effect decays after 8-12 weeks unless paired with reflection and decision-making.

**Meaningful vs. vanity metrics:**
- Vanity: cumulative totals, ever-increasing counters, streak lengths (feel good, don't inform action)
- Meaningful: ratios, trends, rates of change, variability (drive decisions)
- The "So What?" test: if a metric can't answer "what should I do differently?", it's vanity.

**Goodhart's Law in self-tracking:**
- "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Users may optimize the metric (hit 10 approaches) rather than the underlying goal (have genuine interactions).

**Tracking burnout (Etkin, 2016):**
- Tracking can *reduce* enjoyment of the tracked activity (overjustification effect). People who tracked walks enjoyed walking less.
- Signs: tracking becomes guilt-source, missing a day causes disproportionate anxiety, data collected but never reviewed.
- Prevention: minimum viable tracking (3-5 metrics max), seasonal intensity, built-in off-switches.

**Dashboard design principles:**
- Single screen, no scrolling for core view
- Comparison is king: every number needs context (vs. last week, vs. average, vs. goal)
- Progressive disclosure: Level 1 = traffic light overview, Level 2 = drill-down, Level 3 = raw data
- Narrative summaries drive action more than charts alone for many people

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Default views show ratios, trends, and week-over-week deltas -- NOT cumulative totals
- Every metric must pass the "So What?" test: if it can't change behavior, hide it
- Build in seasonal tracking intensity: track more during "experiment" phases, less during maintenance
- Include qualitative alongside quantitative: numbers + brief narrative context
- Progressive disclosure: don't show all data by default. Surface the 3-5 most actionable insights.
- Leverage the Hawthorne effect (monitoring improves behavior) but plan for its decay

### 13. Buddhist/Contemplative Reflection Practices

**Sources:** Satipatthana Sutta (MN 10); Thich Nhat Hanh (1998) *Heart of the Buddha's Teaching*; Kabat-Zinn (1990) *Full Catastrophe Living*; Lieberman et al. (2007) affect labeling study, *Psychological Science*; Khoury et al. (2013) mindfulness meta-analysis (209 studies).

#### Key Findings

**Vipassana evening review:**
- Review the day across four domains: body (physical sensations/actions), feelings (pleasant/unpleasant/neutral), mind states (agitation, calm, generosity), mental patterns (hindrances present, positive qualities present).
- The instruction: "Observe. Do not react." Equanimity toward all experiences.

**Thich Nhat Hanh's "Beginning Anew" (weekly practice):**
1. **Flower watering**: Acknowledge what went well, in yourself and others
2. **Sharing regrets**: Acknowledge where you fell short, without self-punishment
3. **Expressing hurts**: Name what was difficult
4. **Requesting support**: Ask for what you need
- This four-part structure is one of the most complete review frameworks discovered in this research.

**Noting/labeling practice:**
- Label experiences with a single word: "tension," "warmth," "anxiety," "ease"
- Lieberman et al. (2007): simply naming an emotion reduces amygdala activation. Affect labeling IS a therapeutic intervention, not just a data collection step.
- One-word notes are therapeutically active. A complete daily review could be: "Morning: ease. Afternoon: tension. Evening: warmth."

**Observation vs. evaluation -- the critical distinction:**
- Contemplative: "What is present?" vs. Analytical: "How am I doing?"
- Observation has lower cognitive load, higher sustainability, very low risk of harm
- Evaluation has higher cognitive load, lower sustainability, moderate risk of reinforcing self-criticism
- Research (Farb et al., 2007): mindfulness shifts self-referential processing from "narrative" mode (stories about self) to "experiential" mode (present-moment awareness). These activate different neural networks.

**Decentering (Fresco et al., 2007):**
- The ability to observe thoughts as temporary events rather than reflections of reality. Strongest predictor of relapse prevention in MBCT for depression.

**The "Second Arrow" concept (Buddhist psychology):**
- The first arrow is the painful event itself (e.g., rejection) — unavoidable. The second arrow is self-criticism *about* the painful event ("I shouldn't have said that," "What's wrong with me?") — avoidable.
- The Sallatha Sutta distinguishes between the uninstructed person (who adds suffering to pain) and the instructed person (who feels pain without adding layers of suffering).
- Practically: after an unpleasant experience, the reflexive second arrow (rumination, self-blame, catastrophizing) causes more suffering than the original event. This is one of the most directly actionable concepts in contemplative psychology.
- The daily review can serve as a "second arrow detector": prompting users to notice whether they're adding layers of self-criticism to already-painful events.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- **Observation should be the DEFAULT mode; analysis should be opt-in.** "What did you notice?" before "What will you change?"
- Daily review prompt: "Was there a second arrow today?" — trains awareness of self-generated suffering vs. unavoidable pain
- The Beginning Anew 4-part structure (appreciation, regret, difficulty, support request) maps directly to a review flow
- Affect labeling as core mechanism: the system's primary therapeutic value may simply be giving users a structured way to *name* their experiences
- Body-based prompts ("Where do you feel today in your body?") should PRECEDE cognitive prompts
- Use noting/gerund language: "noticing," "experiencing," "feeling" -- emphasizes process over identity
- Brevity is a feature, not a bug: one-word labels are sufficient for daily review

### 14. Circadian Psychology & Optimal Review Timing

**Sources:** Wieth & Zacks (2011) synchrony effect, *Thinking & Reasoning*; Dai, Milkman & Riis (2014) fresh start effect, *Management Science*; Pink (2018) *When*; Roenneberg et al. (2004) chronotype distribution; Scullin et al. (2018) bedtime writing, *JEP: General*.

#### Key Findings

**The synchrony effect:**
- Analytical/convergent thinking peaks at optimal time (mid-morning for most). Creative/insight thinking paradoxically peaks at NON-optimal time (reduced inhibition allows remote associations).
- Morning reviews should be structured/analytical (metrics, patterns). Evening reviews should be reflective/open-ended (insights, feelings, learnings).

**The daily performance pattern (for ~80% of people):**
1. **Peak** (morning): Analytic tasks, vigilance, focus
2. **Trough** (early-to-mid afternoon, 1-3 PM): Worst performance across all cognitive measures
3. **Recovery** (late afternoon/evening): Creative insight, mood rebound

**The fresh start effect (Dai et al., 2014):**
- Temporal landmarks (Mondays, 1st of month, birthdays) create psychological "new beginnings" that boost aspirational motivation. Monday showed the strongest weekly fresh start effect.
- Weekly reviews on Monday leverage this. Frame each day as "fresh start" to trigger the effect.

**Chronotype matters:**
- ~25% definite morning types, ~25% evening types, ~50% intermediate
- Social jetlag: forcing an owl to review at 7 AM is like asking a lark to reflect at midnight
- Young male user base will skew more owl-ish than general population

**Dual-review timing:**
- Evening daily review (7-9 PM): Capture what happened, emotional state, key observations. 1-2 hours before bed.
- Morning daily intention (30-60 min after waking): Review yesterday's capture, set today's focus. Cortisol awakening response window.
- NEVER prompt during the afternoon trough (1-3 PM).

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Match review TYPE to time of day: analytical AM, reflective PM
- Monday is optimal for weekly reviews (fresh start effect + morning analytical peak)
- Detect or ask about chronotype and adjust notification timing
- NEVER prompt reviews during 1:00-3:00 PM
- End reviews on a forward-looking, positive note (peak-end rule: endings color memory of the entire review)
- After missed reviews, use fresh-start framing, not guilt language

### 15. Organizational Learning: Weekly Review Rituals

**Sources:** Amazon WBR documentation; Dalio (2017) *Principles*; Rother (2010) *Toyota Kata*; Fried & Hansson (2013) Basecamp's *Shape Up*; Doerr (2018) *Measure What Matters* (OKRs).

#### Key Findings

**Amazon Weekly Business Review:**
- Input metrics (what you control) over output metrics (results). Focus review on "did I do the actions?" not "did I get the results?"
- Exception-based: green metrics are skipped quickly; red/yellow get deep-dive discussion
- Written narrative for anomalies, not bullet points (forces clarity of thought)

**Bridgewater's Pain + Reflection = Progress:**
- Daily: log "pains" (mistakes, surprises, friction). Weekly: root-cause analysis + principle extraction.
- Every pain should result in a written principle. Over years, these compound into a personal operating system.
- "The daily written record is the raw material; the weekly review is the refinery."

**Toyota Kata -- 5 daily coaching questions:**
1. What is the target condition?
2. What is the actual condition now?
3. What obstacles are preventing you?
4. What is your next experiment?
5. When can we check what we learned?
- The routine IS the skill. Practicing the pattern matters more than any single insight.

**Basecamp weekly check-ins:**
- One question, asynchronous, written: "What did you work on this week?"
- Simple, automatic questions at fixed cadence create reflection habit with zero friction.

**OKR weekly scoring:**
- Score Key Results 0.0-1.0 weekly. 0.7 is the target (0.6-0.7 = ambitious but achievable).
- Confidence tracking (Red/Yellow/Green): the most underrated element. "Am I still on track?" is an early warning system.

#### Key cross-cutting principles:
1. **Two cadences**: Daily (5 min) + Weekly (30 min)
2. **Written > verbal > unstructured thought**
3. **Fixed questions > open-ended reflection**
4. **Input metrics > output metrics**
5. **Anomaly/exception focus** (80% of time on what went off-track)
6. **Blocker surfacing is the highest-value activity**
7. **Small experiments > big plans**
8. **Narrative + numbers, not either/or**

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Input metrics (actions taken) should be primary; output metrics (results) secondary
- Exception-based review: spend most time on what went off-track, not on reviewing green metrics
- Include a "blockers" prompt: "What's in your way?" -- consistently the highest-value question across all systems
- Confidence tracking (R/Y/G) on goals is an early warning system
- Pain logging daily -> principle extraction weekly = a learning compounding machine
- Fixed, simple questions at fixed cadence = lowest friction, highest compliance

### 16. Time Perspective Psychology (Zimbardo)

**Sources:** Zimbardo & Boyd (1999) ZTPI validation, *JPSP*; Zimbardo & Boyd (2008) *The Time Paradox*; Stolarski et al. (2011) BTP and emotional intelligence; Sword et al. (2014) Time Perspective Therapy; Drake et al. (2008) time perspective and wellbeing.

#### Key Findings

**Five time perspectives (ZTPI):**
1. **Past-Negative**: Rumination, regret, "what went wrong" orientation. Strongest negative predictor of wellbeing.
2. **Past-Positive**: Nostalgia, gratitude, identity stability. Necessary but not sufficient for wellbeing.
3. **Present-Hedonistic**: Enjoy the moment, spontaneity. Healthy at moderate levels; undermines reflection at high levels.
4. **Present-Fatalistic**: "Nothing I do matters." Destroys motivation for review entirely.
5. **Future**: Goal-setting, planning, delayed gratification. Strongest predictor of achievement. But extreme future orientation = anxiety treadmill.

**Balanced Time Perspective (BTP):**
- Optimal functioning requires flexible switching between temporal frames. BTP correlates with higher life satisfaction, emotional intelligence (r = 0.44), and mindfulness.
- The ideal: High Past-Positive, Low Past-Negative, Moderate Present-Hedonistic, Low Present-Fatalistic, Moderate-High Future.

**Critical design insight:**
- **The questions you ask literally determine which temporal frame the user enters.** "What went wrong?" activates past-negative. "What are you grateful for?" activates past-positive. "What will you accomplish?" activates future. This is not metaphorical -- it's how memory retrieval works.
- **Without structured prompts, reflection defaults to the dominant (often negative) time perspective.** Open-ended "how was your week?" is an invitation to ruminate for past-negative individuals.

**Prospection / Mental Time Travel (Seligman et al., 2013; Gilbert & Wilson, 2007):**
- Seligman's "Homo Prospectus" thesis: humans are fundamentally driven by mental simulations of the future, not by the past. We are "prospecting" creatures — constantly generating and evaluating predictions about upcoming experiences.
- Vivid prospection (imagining future scenarios in sensory detail) is more motivating than abstract goal-setting. "Imagine yourself walking up to someone tomorrow and feeling calm" vs. "Set a goal to approach someone."
- Different from premeditatio malorum (section 1): premeditatio is *defensive* (what could go wrong?); prospection is *generative* (what will it feel like when it goes well?). Both have value, but prospection for the morning review is underutilized.
- Gilbert & Wilson's "affective forecasting" research: people are poor at predicting future emotions but *better* when they simulate specific scenarios rather than think abstractly. The morning review should leverage vivid, specific prospection.

**The "temporal sandwich" structure:**
1. Present appreciation (savoring)
2. Past-positive meaning-making (gratitude, learning)
3. Future-as-intention (curiosity, not obligation)
4. Present return (agency, enjoyment)

#### Anti-patterns from time perspective research:
| Anti-Pattern | What It Activates | Better Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "What went wrong?" | Past-negative, rumination | "What challenged you, and what did it teach you?" |
| "Did you hit your goals?" (yes/no) | Future anxiety or disengagement | "How did you move toward what matters?" |
| Starting with metrics | Accountability audit | Start with appreciation |
| "What do you need to do better?" | Past-negative + future anxiety | "What would you like to experiment with?" |

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- NEVER start reviews with open-ended "how did it go?" -- this defaults to dominant (often negative) time perspective
- Structure every review to move through past-positive, present, and future in that order
- Use agency language: "What did you choose/create?" not "What happened to you?" (combats fatalism)
- Future-oriented prompts should use curiosity framing ("What are you curious about?") not obligation framing ("What must you do?")
- Morning reviews should leverage vivid prospection: "Imagine tomorrow's session in detail — what does calm confidence feel like?" (not just abstract intention-setting)
- Daily reviews should be 70% present-focused (grounding), 20% past-positive, 10% future
- Weekly reviews should be balanced 33/33/33 across all three time zones

### 17. Decision Journal Methodology

**Sources:** Parrish, S. (Farnam Street) decision journal method; Duke, A. (2018) *Thinking in Bets*; Klein, G. (2007) pre-mortem analysis; Dalio, R. (2017) *Principles*; Douglas, M. (2000) *Trading in the Zone*.

#### Key Findings

**Decision journals (Parrish):**
- Record decisions AT the time of making them (context, alternatives, confidence %, expected outcome, emotional state, falsification criteria). THEN later record actual outcome + lessons.
- Purpose: prevent hindsight bias from contaminating learning. Memory retroactively edits reasoning to match outcomes.

**"Resulting" (Duke):**
- Judging decision quality by outcome quality. The most common decision-review error.
- The 2x2 matrix: Good decision + good outcome (earned). Good decision + bad outcome (bad luck). Bad decision + good outcome (dumb luck). Bad decision + bad outcome (deserved).
- A rejection after a solid approach may be a good-decision-bad-outcome. A number-close from a sloppy approach may be bad-decision-good-outcome.

**Pre-mortem analysis (Klein):**
- "It's next week. This plan has failed spectacularly. Why?" Prospective hindsight increases ability to identify failure modes by 30%.
- At the start of each week: pre-mortem your top goals. At the end: compare predicted vs. actual failures.

**Process over outcome (poker/trading):**
- Grade decisions on process adherence (A-F), completely separate from outcome
- Track "B-game leaks": subtle, repeated deviations from your best decision-making (where the most is lost over time)
- Emotional state logging at decision time: "tilt" detection

**Pain + Reflection = Progress (Dalio):**
- Every significant mistake -> root-cause analysis (Five Whys) -> extract or update a personal principle
- Principles compound over time into a personal operating system

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Weekly review should separate decision quality from outcome quality: "Was this a good process, regardless of result?"
- Include pre-mortem at week-start ("What could go wrong?") and compare against actual outcomes at week-end
- Track confidence calibration over time: "When you said 80% confident, were you right 80% of the time?"
- Include an "anti-resulting" prompt: "Which outcomes this week were earned vs. lucky?"
- Pain/mistake logging daily -> principle extraction weekly = the core learning compounding loop
- Track emotional state at decision-making moments (tired? anxious? overconfident?)

### 18. Habit Design for the Review Practice Itself

**Sources:** Clear (2018) *Atomic Habits*; Fogg (2020) *Tiny Habits*; Gollwitzer (1999) implementation intentions, *American Psychologist*; Gollwitzer & Sheeran (2006) meta-analysis (94 studies, d = 0.65); Lally et al. (2010) habit formation (66-day average).

#### Key Findings

**Implementation intentions (Gollwitzer):**
- "If [SITUATION], then I will [BEHAVIOR]." Meta-analysis effect size d = 0.65 on goal attainment.
- Landmark study (Milne et al., 2002): implementation intentions raised exercise rate from 38% to 91%.
- During onboarding, have users explicitly choose their review trigger: "I will review at [TIME] in [LOCATION] after [ANCHOR HABIT]."

**Tiny Habits (Fogg):**
- B = MAP (Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Prompt). Never rely on motivation; make the behavior tiny enough to require near-zero motivation.
- Start with: "Open the app." That's it. Celebrate. Build from there.
- Celebration within 0.5 seconds of the behavior wires the habit neurologically ("Shine").
- 65% of participants maintained habits at 6 months using full MAP + celebration protocol.

**Habit graduation (progressive overload):**
- Never increase difficulty AND frequency simultaneously
- Week 1-2: one-tap rating (5 sec). Week 3-4: rating + count (10 sec). Week 5-6: + one highlight (30 sec). Week 7-8: structured 3-field entry (1-2 min). Week 9+: full review if desired.
- Track which level the user is at; only present that level's fields by default.

**Minimum Viable Review:**
- Di Stefano et al. (2016, Harvard Business School): 15 min daily reflection produced 22.8% better performance. Even brief reflection had significant effects.
- The testing effect (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006): simply recalling what happened strengthens the memory. The review's primary mechanism IS retrieval practice.
- Level 0: "I went out today" (2 sec). Level 1: Rating (5 sec). Level 2: Rating + count (10 sec). Level 3: Quick debrief (30 sec). Level 4: Structured review (2-5 min). Level 5: Deep review (10-15 min).

**Streak psychology:**
- Streaks increase engagement by 27% but also increase dropout after breaks by 40% (Silverman, 2015).
- Solution: flexible streaks (5/7 days counts), streak freezes, "longest ever" preserved, partial credit for showing up.
- The abstinence violation effect: one missed day -> "I failed" -> quit entirely. Design against this.

**Friction reduction:**
- Each additional form field reduces mobile completion by ~7-10% (Google, 2016).
- Hierarchy from lowest friction: one-tap binary > slider/scale > chip select > pre-filled editable > voice > short text > long text.
- Pre-fill everything possible. Default values reduce friction. "Same as yesterday" button for routine days.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- During onboarding, have users form an explicit implementation intention (when/where/after what)
- Start absurdly tiny: the default first-time review is ONE TAP. Celebrate it.
- Graduate deliberately: only offer more fields after consistency at current level
- Never gate "complete" on filling everything out -- showing up counts
- Use flexible streaks (5/7 weekly targets, streak freezes, "longest ever" display)
- Pre-fill aggressively, use one-tap inputs as primary, voice as secondary, free text only for optional fields
- Immediate micro-celebration after every review completion (animation, checkmark, sound)

### 19. Meaning-Making & Emotional Processing for Rejection

**Sources:** Park & Folkman (1997) meaning-making model; Tedeschi & Calhoun (2004) post-traumatic growth; Eisenberger et al. (2003) social pain neuroimaging, *Science*; Williams (2009) ostracism temporal model; Frankl (1946) *Man's Search for Meaning*; Helgeson et al. (2006) benefit finding meta-analysis.

#### Key Findings

**Social rejection activates physical pain circuits:**
- Eisenberger et al. (2003): fMRI shows social exclusion activates the same dACC and anterior insula regions as physical pain. The pain is neurologically real, not metaphorical.
- Tylenol actually reduces social pain (DeWall et al., 2010), confirming shared circuitry.

**Williams' temporal model of rejection response:**
1. **Reflexive** (seconds-minutes): Automatic pain. Cannot be thought away.
2. **Reflective** (minutes-hours): Cognitive appraisal begins. Where meaning-making can intervene.
3. **Resignation** (chronic): Emotional numbing, withdrawal, helplessness. A warning sign, not progress.

**Post-Traumatic Growth (Tedeschi & Calhoun):**
- Growth comes THROUGH struggling with difficulty, not despite it. Five domains: new possibilities, deeper relationships, personal strength, appreciation of life, existential understanding.
- Critical: **intrusive rumination** (obsessive replay) predicts distress. **Deliberate rumination** (structured reflection) predicts growth. The review system IS the mechanism that channels intrusive into deliberate.

**Meaning-making (Park & Folkman):**
- When an event's meaning violates core beliefs, distress results. Resolution comes through either changing the event's meaning (reappraisal) or updating beliefs to be more nuanced.
- Don't rush meaning. "I'm still processing" is a valid answer. Track evolution of meaning over weeks.

**Benefit finding -- when it helps vs. harms:**
- Helps when: specific, grounded, emerges naturally over time, coexists with honest pain acknowledgment
- Harms when: premature, used to bypass pain, vague ("everything happens for a reason"), imposed by others
- Authentic: "This was hard AND I found something useful." Toxic: "This was hard BUT focus on the positive."

**Frankl's logotherapy:**
- "He who has a 'why' can bear almost any 'how.'" Three meaning pathways: creative (what you give), experiential (what you receive), attitudinal (the stance you take toward unavoidable suffering).
- Tragic optimism: maintaining hope IN SPITE of pain, not by denying it.

**Shattered Assumptions Theory (Janoff-Bulman, 1992):**
- Trauma and repeated failure can shatter three core beliefs: (1) "The world is benevolent," (2) "The world is meaningful/predictable," (3) "I am worthy."
- When repeated rejection challenges fundamental self-worth beliefs, standard meaning-making frameworks (reappraisal, benefit finding) may be insufficient. The person needs to rebuild core assumptions, not just reframe individual events.
- Recovery involves constructing more nuanced, resilient belief systems: "Most people are decent, but not everyone will be interested" rather than either "Everyone is kind" (shattered by rejection) or "No one is kind" (over-corrected).
- Design implication: the weekly review should periodically track belief system evolution, not just event processing. "How has your view of [yourself / others / the process] changed this month?"

**Dual-Process Model of Coping (Stroebe & Schut, 1999):**
- Healthy coping oscillates between **loss-oriented processing** (sitting with difficulty, grieving, processing emotions) and **restoration-oriented processing** (moving forward, doing new things, rebuilding).
- Problems occur when someone gets stuck in one mode: all loss-processing = rumination and depression. All restoration = avoidance and delayed grief.
- The review system should honor BOTH modes and detect which the user needs. Sometimes "What did you learn?" is premature — the answer is "I just need to feel this."
- Oscillation between the two modes IS healthy coping. The review should NOT always push toward extraction/growth (restoration-oriented). Sometimes the correct review is purely emotional processing (loss-oriented).

#### The evidence-based processing sequence (ORDER MATTERS):
1. **ACKNOWLEDGE** -- Validate the pain as real and biological
2. **FEEL** -- Don't bypass emotional reality
3. **EXAMINE** -- What happened vs. expected? What does the gap tell you?
4. **CONNECT** -- What social interactions went well? (social snacking)
5. **EXTRACT** -- Is there anything useful? (optional, not forced)
6. **GROW** -- How are you different than when you started?
7. **ORIENT** -- Why does this matter to you? What's next?

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Pain before growth: emotional acknowledgment MUST precede benefit finding
- "I'm still processing" is always a valid answer. Never force premature meaning-making
- Normalize rejection pain: "Your brain processes this like physical pain -- the sting is real"
- Monitor for resignation: sustained emotional flatness or withdrawal is a danger sign
- Include "social snacking" (positive social recall) after processing difficult rejections
- The weekly review structure channels intrusive rumination into deliberate rumination -- this IS the therapeutic mechanism
- Connect to personal meaning: "Why are you doing this? Not the surface reason -- the deeper one"
- Track belief system evolution monthly: "How has your view of yourself/others changed?" (Shattered Assumptions)
- Honor dual-process oscillation: don't always push toward growth. Sometimes pure emotional processing IS the correct review
- Detect which mode the user needs: if they've been in loss-processing for weeks, gently offer restoration prompts. If they're avoiding emotions, offer space to feel.

### 20. Academic Research on Journaling Efficacy

**Sources:** Frattaroli (2006) meta-analysis (146 studies), *Psychological Bulletin*; Smyth (1998) meta-analysis, *JCCP*; Dickens (2017) gratitude meta-analysis; Ullrich & Lutgendorf (2002) cognitive processing; Pennebaker (1997) expressive writing; Burton & King (2004) positive writing; Di Stefano et al. (2016) reflection and performance.

#### Key Findings

**Overall effect sizes are modest:**
- Frattaroli (2006, 146 studies): overall d = 0.075 (small but significant). The earlier Smyth (1998) found d = 0.47, but this shrank as more studies were included (classic publication bias pattern).
- Journaling is not a silver bullet. It works better for specific subgroups: people with active stressors, clinical populations, as complement to other interventions.

**Structured > unstructured:**
- Ullrich & Lutgendorf (2002): cognitive processing + emotion condition showed best outcomes. Pure emotional venting without meaning-making did NOT improve outcomes.
- The mechanism is not catharsis but **cognitive reappraisal and narrative construction**.
- Sweet spot: prompts that guide toward (a) emotional acknowledgment, (b) sense-making, (c) future-oriented thinking.

**Gratitude journaling -- more modest than hyped:**
- Dickens (2017): d ~ 0.31 for well-being, d ~ 0.12 for depression/anxiety. When compared to active controls, many effects become non-significant.
- Include as minor component, not centerpiece. Self-efficacy reflection has stronger basis.

**Prompts that work:**
- Pennebaker LIWC findings: most beneficial writing shows increasing causal words (because, reason) and insight words (understand, realize) over sessions, indicating narrative construction.
- Best prompts combine event recall + emotional acknowledgment + meaning-making + future action.

**Frequency:**
- No clear dose-response above 3-4x/week. Daily is not clearly superior to 3x/week.
- Forced daily journaling risks compliance fatigue (entries become rote and shallow).
- Some journaling > no journaling, with diminishing returns above 3-4 sessions/week.

**Session duration:**
- 15-20 minutes optimal for emotional processing (below 10 = too surface; above 25 = no additional benefit, increased rumination risk).
- 2-5 minutes sufficient for positive/reflective journaling (Burton & King, 2004: 2 min of positive writing x 3 days produced measurable health benefits).
- Daily check-in: 2-5 min. Weekly review: 15-20 min.

**Digital vs. paper:**
- No robust meta-analysis exists. Handwriting may produce deeper processing per session, but digital's accessibility advantage (notifications, lower friction, phone availability) means more total sessions. Adherence matters more than medium.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Use moderate structure: not blank pages (risks rumination), not rigid checkboxes (risks superficial compliance)
- Pair emotional prompts with cognitive processing: always follow "how do you feel?" with "what does it mean?" and "what will you do?"
- Default frequency: 3-5x/week for daily check-ins, 1x/week for deep review. Don't mandate daily.
- Daily check-in: 2-5 min. Weekly review: 15-20 min. Don't design 30+ min sessions.
- Gratitude is a minor component, not the centerpiece. Self-efficacy reflection is stronger.
- Rotate prompts to prevent staleness and formulaic answers
- Do not over-promise on journaling outcomes. It is a useful complement, not a transformation engine.

### 21. Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) / Psychological Flexibility

**Sources:** Hayes, S.C., Strosahl, K.D. & Wilson, K.G. (2012) *Acceptance and Commitment Therapy*, 2nd ed; Hayes et al. (2006) meta-analysis, *Behaviour Research and Therapy*; Kashdan & Rottenberg (2010) psychological flexibility, *Clinical Psychology Review*; Bond et al. (2011) AAQ-II validation; Luoma et al. (2007) *Learning ACT*.

#### Key Findings

**The hexaflex model — 6 dimensions of psychological flexibility:**
1. **Acceptance**: Willingness to experience uncomfortable emotions without trying to change them
2. **Cognitive defusion**: Seeing thoughts as thoughts (mental events), not as facts or commands
3. **Present-moment awareness**: Contact with the here-and-now
4. **Self-as-context**: The observing self that is larger than any thought, feeling, or role
5. **Values**: Chosen life directions (not goals — ongoing qualities of action)
6. **Committed action**: Concrete behavior aligned with values

**How ACT differs from CBT (covered in section 5):**
- CBT approach to negative thought: "Challenge it. Is it true? What's the evidence?"
- ACT approach: "Notice it. It's a thought. You can have the thought AND still act on your values."
- CBT tries to change thought *content*. ACT changes the *relationship* to thoughts. Both are evidence-based; ACT may be more appropriate when rejection thoughts are partially true (you DID get rejected — there's nothing to "challenge").

**Defusion techniques relevant to reviews:**
- "I'm having the thought that I'm not good enough" (vs. "I'm not good enough") — adding "I'm having the thought that..." creates distance
- "My mind is telling me a story about failure" — externalizes the narrative
- Labeling thoughts as thoughts reduces their behavioral impact without requiring them to be "wrong"

**Values-based living:**
- Values are ongoing directions, not achievable endpoints. "Being courageous" vs. "Get 10 approaches" (goal).
- Daily/weekly reviews that track values alignment ("Did I move toward my values today?") are more sustainable than goal-tracking alone, because values can't be "completed" or "failed."
- The "Values Bull's Eye" exercise: rate how closely you lived in alignment with your values across domains (relationships, personal growth, health, etc.) — a weekly assessment tool rivaling PERMA.

**Willingness:**
- The willingness to experience discomfort in the service of values. Central to this context: "Am I willing to feel the nervousness/awkwardness/rejection that comes with living according to my value of [courage/connection/growth]?"
- This reframes the question from "How do I stop feeling anxious?" to "What am I willing to feel in the service of what matters to me?"

**Meta-analysis results:**
- Hayes et al. (2006): ACT shows medium-to-large effects across anxiety, depression, chronic pain, substance use. Psychological flexibility mediates outcomes across conditions.
- Kashdan & Rottenberg (2010): psychological flexibility is a key predictor of mental health — arguably more predictive than any single positive psychology construct.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Add "values alignment" tracking to weekly reviews: "How closely did I live my values this week?" (Bull's Eye format)
- Defusion prompts for daily review: "What story is your mind telling you?" / "What thought kept showing up today?"
- Willingness check: "What discomfort were you willing to feel today in the service of what matters?"
- ACT provides the missing framework for when CBT reappraisal doesn't work (the thought IS partially true)
- The hexaflex could serve as a periodic assessment tool alongside PERMA
- Values ≠ goals: review prompts should distinguish "Did I move toward my values?" from "Did I hit my targets?"

### 22. Polyvagal Theory / Nervous System State

**Sources:** Porges, S.W. (2011) *The Polyvagal Theory*; Porges (2017) *The Pocket Guide to the Polyvagal Theory*; Dana, D. (2018) *The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy*; Dana (2020) *Polyvagal Exercises for Safety and Connection*; Porges & Dana (2018) *Clinical Applications of the Polyvagal Theory*.

#### Key Findings

**Three autonomic states (hierarchy):**
1. **Ventral vagal** (safe & social): Social engagement system active. Calm, connected, curious, open to reflection. Can access higher-order thinking, narrative construction, and learning.
2. **Sympathetic** (fight/flight): Mobilization. Activated, anxious, agitated, defensive. Can take action but NOT reflect meaningfully — cognitive bandwidth narrows to threat response.
3. **Dorsal vagal** (freeze/shutdown): Immobilization. Numb, disconnected, collapsed, "checked out." Cannot engage with structured reflection at all. Needs co-regulation (connection with safety) first.

**The foundational question the review system must answer:**
- BEFORE presenting review prompts: what nervous system state is the user in? Can they even reflect meaningfully right now?
- Ventral vagal → full review is appropriate
- Sympathetic → only quick capture is appropriate (one-tap rating, brief voice note). Structured reflection will feel like pressure.
- Dorsal vagal → review would be harmful. The system should detect this and offer co-regulation (calming content, grounding exercises, permission to rest) rather than review prompts.

**Neuroception — unconscious safety detection:**
- The nervous system constantly scans for cues of safety or danger, below conscious awareness. The review interface itself sends neuroceptive cues: warm language and optional fields = safety cues. Mandatory fields and evaluative language = threat cues.
- Design the review to send safety signals: warm tone, user-controlled pacing, no judgment, easy exit.

**State detection through self-report:**
- Dana's "Personal Profile Map" asks: "Right now, am I feeling safe/connected, activated/on-edge, or shut down/numb?"
- A simple 3-state check at the start of any review could adapt the entire flow.
- Body-based cues are more reliable than cognitive self-assessment for detecting state: "Is your jaw clenched? Shoulders tight? Breathing shallow?" = sympathetic. "Feeling heavy, spacey, disconnected?" = dorsal.

**Co-regulation before self-regulation:**
- Porges: the nervous system is wired to regulate through social connection FIRST, self-regulation SECOND. When someone is dysregulated, a warm human presence (or its simulation through empathic interface design) is the fastest path to ventral vagal.
- This has implications for AI-assisted reviews: the system's "tone" can provide micro-co-regulation.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Add a nervous system state check at the START of every review: "How are you feeling right now? (Connected / Activated / Shut down)"
- Adapt review depth based on state: ventral = full review, sympathetic = quick capture only, dorsal = grounding + permission to skip
- Design the review interface to send safety signals: warm language, optional everything, easy exit, no evaluation
- Body-based prompts FIRST (breathing, body scan, physical state) — these are more accurate state indicators than "How do you feel emotionally?"
- Never present a full structured review to someone in fight/flight or shutdown — it will feel like pressure and worsen the state
- The review system itself should be a co-regulation tool: empathic tone, pacing that matches the user, validation before prompts

### 23. Emotional Granularity (Constructed Emotion Theory)

**Sources:** Barrett, L.F. (2017) *How Emotions Are Made*; Barrett et al. (2001) emotional granularity and regulation, *JPSP*; Kashdan et al. (2015) emotional differentiation, *JESP*; Tugade et al. (2004) emotional complexity and resilience; Smidt & Suvak (2015) granularity meta-review.

#### Key Findings

**Emotional granularity defined:**
- The ability to make fine-grained distinctions between similar emotional states. High granularity: distinguishing "disappointed" from "embarrassed" from "dejected" from "frustrated." Low granularity: "I feel bad."
- This goes significantly deeper than the affect labeling covered in section 13, which addressed the benefit of naming emotions at all. Granularity addresses the *precision* of that naming.

**Constructed emotion theory (Barrett):**
- Emotions are not hardwired categories triggered by events. They are predictions constructed by the brain, drawing on past experience and conceptual knowledge.
- People with richer emotional concepts (more words, more distinctions) literally *experience* emotions differently — they have more tools for constructing nuanced emotional responses.
- Expanding emotional vocabulary doesn't just describe emotions better — it changes the emotional experience itself.

**Granularity predicts regulation:**
- Barrett et al. (2001): individuals with higher negative emotional granularity use more varied and effective emotion regulation strategies. They can select the right tool because they have a more precise diagnosis.
- Low granularity → one-size-fits-all coping (e.g., always suppressing, or always venting)
- High granularity → targeted coping (e.g., "I'm disappointed — I'll adjust expectations" vs. "I'm embarrassed — I'll normalize the experience" vs. "I'm frustrated — I'll change my approach")

**Granularity is trainable:**
- Vocabulary expansion through structured practice increases granularity over time.
- Emotion wheels (Plutchik), granular emotion lists, and progressive chip-select options can gradually teach finer distinctions.

**Granularity and resilience (Tugade et al., 2004):**
- People who differentiate positive emotions (distinguishing "grateful" from "proud" from "amused" from "serene") show greater resilience to stress. Not just negative emotion granularity matters.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- The review system should gradually teach finer emotional vocabulary through expanding chip-select options over time
- Start with basic emotions (happy, sad, anxious, calm, frustrated, excited) for beginners
- Progressively introduce more granular options as users develop: "disappointed" vs. "dejected" vs. "disheartened" vs. "let down"
- Pair emotion labels with brief definitions/examples to build conceptual knowledge
- Track emotional granularity growth over time as a meta-metric: are users using more precise language month over month?
- Include positive emotion granularity, not just negative: "Which flavor of positive? Proud / Grateful / Amused / Energized / Peaceful / Connected"
- The expanding vocabulary IS a therapeutic intervention, not just a data collection improvement

### 24. Compassion-Focused Therapy / Three-System Model

**Sources:** Gilbert, P. (2010) *The Compassionate Mind*; Gilbert (2014) *Compassion-Focused Therapy*, *Clinical Psychology Review*; Gilbert & Procter (2006) compassionate mind training; Kirby et al. (2017) CFT meta-analysis; Neff, K.D. (2003) self-compassion scale (related, covered in field reports doc).

#### Key Findings

**The three emotional regulation systems (Gilbert):**
1. **Threat system** (protection): Detects danger, triggers fight/flight/freeze. Emotions: anxiety, anger, disgust. Dominant in high-stress activities. Fast, loud, overrides other systems.
2. **Drive system** (resource-seeking): Pursuing goals, achievements, status. Emotions: excitement, anticipation, wanting. Dominant in goal-pursuit phases. Feels energizing but can be exhausting.
3. **Soothing system** (contentment/safety): Connection, warmth, rest, satisfaction. Emotions: calm, contentment, safeness. Activates through affiliation, touch, warmth.

**The critical insight for this context:**
- People doing challenging self-improvement typically oscillate between **threat** (fear of failure, social rejection) and **drive** (excitement about progress, pursuing goals), rarely activating the **soothing** system.
- Without soothing activation, the person is running on cortisol and dopamine without oxytocin. This is unsustainable and leads to burnout, harsh self-criticism, and eventual withdrawal.
- Different from Neff's self-compassion (covered in the field reports doc): Gilbert provides the *mechanism* (three-system model) while Neff provides the *practice* (self-compassion exercises).

**Deliberate soothing activation:**
- The soothing system can be deliberately activated through: warm tone of voice (including inner voice), imagery (safe place, compassionate figure), physical warmth, slow breathing, affiliative connection.
- Reviews should deliberately activate the soothing system, especially after difficult periods. This is not "being soft" — it's neurological rebalancing.

**The "compassionate self" exercise:**
- Imagine yourself at your wisest, most compassionate. From that perspective, review your week. This shifts self-evaluation from the threat system (inner critic) to the soothing system (compassionate observer).
- Distinct from "self-as-context" in ACT: the compassionate self has specific qualities (warmth, wisdom, strength, non-judgment) rather than being a neutral observer.

**CFT meta-analysis (Kirby et al., 2017):**
- CFT shows moderate-to-large effects on self-compassion (d = 0.70), depression (d = 0.64), and anxiety (d = 0.49). Effects are particularly strong for people high in self-criticism — the most relevant population for challenging self-improvement.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Weekly reviews should include deliberate soothing system activation: warm language, appreciation before critique, permission to rest
- Add a "compassionate self" perspective prompt: "Looking at your week through the eyes of your wisest, most compassionate self — what do you see?"
- Detect threat/drive imbalance: if daily ratings show high effort + high anxiety + low contentment, the system should prompt soothing practices
- The review ending should activate soothing (contentment, warmth, sufficiency) not just drive (goals, next steps, ambition)
- For users high in self-criticism: CFT-informed prompts should precede standard evaluation prompts
- Include periodic "three-system check-in": "This week, how much time did you spend in anxiety/fear, excitement/drive, and calm/contentment?"

### 25. Stages of Change / Motivational Interviewing

**Sources:** Prochaska, J.O. & DiClemente, C.C. (1983) Transtheoretical Model; Prochaska et al. (1992) stages of change, *American Psychologist*; Miller, W.R. & Rollnick, S. (2013) *Motivational Interviewing*, 3rd ed; Hettema et al. (2005) MI meta-analysis; Lundahl et al. (2010) MI meta-analysis (119 studies).

#### Key Findings

**Five stages of change:**
1. **Precontemplation**: Not considering change. "I don't need to do this." Reviews here should raise awareness, not push action.
2. **Contemplation**: Ambivalent. "I want to but..." Reviews should explore ambivalence, not resolve it prematurely.
3. **Preparation**: Ready to start. "I'm going to start next week." Reviews should support planning and commitment.
4. **Action**: Actively changing behavior. "I'm doing it." Reviews should reinforce effort and troubleshoot obstacles.
5. **Maintenance**: Sustaining change. "I've been doing this for months." Reviews should focus on preventing relapse and deepening integration.

**Users at different stages need fundamentally different review prompts:**
- Giving action-stage prompts ("What did you do this week?") to someone in contemplation creates pressure and resistance
- Giving contemplation-stage prompts ("Are you ready?") to someone in action is patronizing and undermining
- The review system should detect or ask about the user's current stage and adapt accordingly

**Motivational Interviewing (MI) principles:**
1. **Express empathy**: Understand the user's experience without judgment
2. **Develop discrepancy**: Help the user see the gap between current behavior and values/goals (without imposing it)
3. **Roll with resistance**: When the user pushes back, don't push harder. Resistance is information.
4. **Support self-efficacy**: Highlight the user's own capacity and past successes
5. **Evoke change talk**: Draw out the user's OWN motivation rather than imposing external motivation

**Change talk vs. sustain talk:**
- Change talk: statements in favor of change ("I want to," "I could," "I need to," "I'm going to")
- Sustain talk: statements against change ("I can't," "It's too hard," "I don't want to")
- The review should evoke change talk through open questions: "What would be different if you were practicing consistently?" (evokes desire for change)
- Never argue against sustain talk — it strengthens resistance

**MI meta-analyses:**
- Lundahl et al. (2010, 119 studies): MI shows significant effects across health behaviors, with strongest effects on substance use (d = 0.28) and moderate effects on health-related behaviors (d = 0.22). Effect is strongest in brief formats (1-2 sessions).
- MI's "spirit" (collaborative, evocative, honoring autonomy) matters more than specific techniques.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Detect or assess the user's stage of change and adapt review prompts accordingly
- Early stages: exploratory, values-clarifying prompts. Later stages: action-focused, troubleshooting prompts
- The review should evoke the user's OWN motivation, not impose external motivation ("What matters to you about this?" not "You should keep going")
- When users express resistance or ambivalence, explore it rather than counter it: "What's making this feel difficult?" not "But think about how far you've come!"
- MI's spirit aligns with SDT (section 9): autonomy-supportive, evoking rather than telling
- Sustain-talk detection: if daily reviews show increasing "I can't" / "what's the point" language, the system should shift to MI-style exploration rather than pushing action

### 26. Identity-Based Motivation

**Sources:** Oyserman, D. (2015) *Pathways to Success Through Identity-Based Motivation*; Oyserman et al. (2006) possible selves and academic outcomes; Oyserman & Destin (2010) identity-based motivation theory; Markus & Nurius (1986) possible selves; Clear, J. (2018) identity-based habits (popularized version).

#### Key Findings

**Identity-based motivation (Oyserman):**
- People are more motivated when they connect current actions to a **possible future self** — a vivid image of who they could become.
- Motivation increases when: (1) the future self feels connected to the present self, (2) the path from here to there feels plausible, and (3) difficulty is interpreted as meaning "this is important" rather than "this isn't for me."
- Deeper than Clear's "identity-based habits" (vote for the person you want to become): Oyserman's research shows that the *relationship* between current and future self determines motivation, not just the identity label.

**Possible selves (Markus & Nurius, 1986):**
- People carry both "hoped-for" selves (who I want to become) and "feared" selves (who I want to avoid becoming).
- Both are motivating, but hoped-for selves sustain long-term motivation better. Feared selves create avoidance motivation (effective short-term, exhausting long-term).
- Weekly reviews tracking identity evolution ("What kind of person am I becoming?") rather than just goal progress leverage this mechanism.

**Difficulty-as-importance interpretation:**
- When people encounter difficulty in pursuing a goal, they interpret it through their identity lens:
  - Identity-congruent interpretation: "This is hard BECAUSE it matters to me" → persist
  - Identity-incongruent interpretation: "This is hard BECAUSE it's not for someone like me" → withdraw
- The review system can prime the identity-congruent interpretation: "What did this difficulty tell you about what you care about?"

**The temporal connection problem:**
- Research shows that people often feel disconnected from their future selves — treating the future self almost like a stranger. This disconnection undermines long-term motivation.
- Writing about and vividly imagining the future self creates stronger temporal connection and increases goal-directed behavior.

**Oyserman's intervention studies:**
- School-based interventions that helped students develop vivid possible selves and connect them to current actions produced significant improvements in attendance, GPA, and reduced behavioral problems (d = 0.3-0.5).

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Weekly reviews should track identity evolution: "What kind of person are you becoming through this practice?"
- Include "possible self" prompts periodically: "Imagine yourself 6 months from now, having practiced consistently. What's different about that person?"
- Reframe difficulty through identity: "This challenge is telling you something about what matters to you" rather than "This is hard but keep going"
- Connect daily actions to identity: "How did today's actions reflect the person you want to be?"
- Track both hoped-for and feared selves: "Who are you becoming?" AND "Who are you choosing not to be?"
- The future-self connection is a weekly review function: daily is too granular for identity tracking; weekly creates the right temporal distance for identity reflection

### 27. Attachment Theory & Heartbreak Processing

**Sources:** Hazan, C. & Shaver, P.R. (1987) romantic attachment as an attachment process, *JPSP*; Bartholomew, K. & Horowitz, L.M. (1991) four-category model of adult attachment, *JPSP*; Mikulincer, M. & Shaver, P.R. (2016) *Attachment in Adulthood: Structure, Dynamics, and Change*, 2nd ed.; Tennov, D. (1979) *Love and Limerence*; Shear, M.K. et al. (2011) complicated grief treatment, *JAMA Psychiatry*; Fraley, R.C. (2002) attachment stability review, *Personality and Social Psychology Review*.

#### Key Findings

**The four adult attachment styles:**
- **Secure** (~55% of population): Comfortable with intimacy and autonomy. Process rejection as situational ("we weren't compatible") rather than global ("I'm unlovable"). Recover faster, maintain self-esteem.
- **Anxious/Preoccupied** (~20%): Hyperactivate attachment system under stress. Seek excessive reassurance, ruminate on rejection, interpret ambiguous signals as rejection, difficulty letting go. Rejection triggers abandonment fears → protest behaviors → more rejection.
- **Avoidant/Dismissive** (~25%): Deactivate attachment system under stress. Minimize importance of relationships, suppress emotions, may appear to "get over it" quickly but often have unprocessed grief. Intellectualize rather than feel.
- **Fearful-Avoidant/Disorganized** (~5%): Both hyperactivate AND deactivate — want closeness but fear it. Most volatile response to rejection. Often have trauma history. May oscillate between desperate pursuit and cold withdrawal.

**How attachment style affects rejection response:**
- Anxious: Rejection confirms core fear ("I knew they'd leave"). Prolonged distress, seeking contact even when harmful, difficulty accepting reality of loss.
- Avoidant: Suppress immediate pain but may have delayed grief emergence. "I'm fine" masks ongoing impact. May quickly seek new relationships to avoid processing.
- Secure: Can experience intense initial pain but maintain self-worth. Use social support effectively. Process loss without identity collapse.
- Disorganized: Unpredictable swings between desperate connection-seeking and complete shutdown. Highest risk of crisis.

**Limerence vs. healthy attraction (Tennov, 1979):**
- Limerence = involuntary obsessive infatuation characterized by intrusive thinking, fear of rejection, mood dependency on reciprocation, idealization
- Estimated duration: 18 months to 3 years without reciprocation
- Limerence is NOT love — it's an attachment-system hijack. Standard "move on" advice doesn't work because it's not under conscious control.
- Key distinction: healthy attraction allows focus on other life domains; limerence consumes cognitive bandwidth
- Resolution requires: no contact (feeding hope resets the clock), processing underlying attachment wound, building alternative secure attachments

**Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD) crossover:**
- Originally identified in ADHD literature but relevant here: some individuals experience rejection as visceral, overwhelming emotional pain far beyond typical response
- RSD makes standard rejection "reframing" exercises feel invalidating — the pain is real, not cognitive distortion
- Requires different approach: validation first, emotional regulation, recognizing pattern without dismissing intensity

**Grief vs. growth-oriented processing:**
- Standard review prompts ("What did you learn?") can feel invalidating during acute grief
- Stroebe & Schut's dual-process model: healthy processing oscillates between loss-orientation (feeling the pain) and restoration-orientation (rebuilding)
- Forcing premature meaning-making ("benefit finding") during loss-orientation phase can backfire
- Review system must detect phase and adapt prompts accordingly

**Secure base theory — what's missing:**
- Bowlby: humans need a "secure base" — a felt sense of someone being there for them — to explore confidently
- For insecurely attached people, romantic interest often becomes proxy secure base → loss = loss of psychological safety, not just loss of person
- Building internal secure base requires: consistent self-compassion practice, reliable non-romantic relationships, therapeutic work on early attachment wounds

**When rejection = attachment wound activation:**
- Present rejection can activate early attachment wounds (childhood abandonment, neglect, inconsistent caregiving)
- Signs this is happening: intensity disproportionate to relationship length/depth, familiar feeling ("this always happens to me"), regression to childlike emotional states
- Standard review prompts can retraumatize if they encourage re-exposure without support
- Requires trauma-informed approach: stabilization before exploration, resource before processing

**Healing vs. re-traumatizing reflection prompts:**
- HARMFUL during acute attachment wound activation: "What could you have done differently?" "What does this say about you?" "Describe what happened in detail"
- HELPFUL: "What do you need right now?" "Who in your life feels safe?" "What would you say to a friend going through this?"
- The review system must detect attachment-wound activation and switch to soothing/stabilization mode

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Add attachment style as a personalization dimension in S2 — different templates for different styles
- For anxious attachment: prompts that don't encourage rumination, emphasis on present moment and other relationships, guard against "analysis of what went wrong"
- For avoidant attachment: prompts that gently invite emotional access, validation that it's okay to feel, guard against premature "moving on"
- For disorganized: high-support templates, frequent state checks, easy access to crisis resources, shorter review sessions
- Add "secure base building" prompts: "Who in your life can you count on?" "What helps you feel safe?"
- Include limerence detection: if obsessive thinking patterns detected, provide psychoeducation and suggest structured no-contact support
- Adapt prompts based on grief phase: loss-orientation days get validation and feeling prompts; restoration-orientation days get gentle forward-looking prompts
- Never force benefit-finding during acute grief — detect and defer
- Create "heartbreak protocol" template variant that prioritizes soothing over learning

### 28. High Performer & Success Psychology

**Sources:** Ben-Shahar, T. (2007) *Happier* and arrival fallacy concept; Brickman, P. & Campbell, D.T. (1971) hedonic treadmill theory; Lyubomirsky, S. (2007) *The How of Happiness* and adaptation research; Gilbert, D. (2006) *Stumbling on Happiness* and miswanting; Ericsson, A. (2016) *Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise*; Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1990) *Flow* — expertise-level challenges; elite athlete post-competition psychology literature.

#### Key Findings

**Arrival fallacy (Ben-Shahar):**
- The false belief that reaching a goal will bring lasting happiness
- People pursue goals expecting emotional payoff → achieve goal → brief satisfaction → return to baseline → "Now what?"
- Particularly acute after long-pursued goals: "I worked toward this for years... and I don't feel different"
- The emptiness after achievement can trigger depression, identity crisis, or compulsive goal escalation
- The fallacy isn't that achievement doesn't matter — it's that the anticipation overpromises and the achievement underdelivers

**Hedonic adaptation (Brickman & Campbell):**
- Humans adapt to both positive and negative circumstances faster than predicted
- Lottery winners return to baseline happiness within 1-2 years
- Success experiences the same adaptation: what felt amazing becomes the new normal
- Effect sizes: major life events affect happiness far less than predicted and for far shorter than expected
- Implication: the person getting consistent results will soon experience them as "just normal" — the thrill fades

**Miswanting (Gilbert):**
- People systematically mispredict what will make them happy
- Common miswanting in high performers: believing more success will satisfy the drive that created success
- The drive itself is often compensating for something (insecurity, childhood wounds, need for validation) → success doesn't address the underlying need
- Review prompts should help surface WHAT the person was actually seeking (often not what they nominally pursued)

**Winner's problems:**
- **Abundance paralysis**: Too many options → decision fatigue → paralysis or arbitrary choices
- **Maintaining hunger**: The drive that fueled early success may not function the same once basic needs are met
- **Validation dependency**: If success was driven by external validation, continued success just maintains addiction rather than satisfying it
- **Lifestyle inflation**: Resources increase → expectations increase → hedonic treadmill accelerates
- **Threat of loss**: Having something to lose changes psychology from approach to protection orientation

**Identity after achievement:**
- "I got what I wanted... now what?" is a genuine psychological crisis
- Identity built around "becoming" doesn't have a script for "being"
- Without new goals, some experience purposelessness; others experience compulsive goal escalation to avoid the feeling
- The review system should help reorient from achievement-identity to values-identity: "Who do you want to BE, not just what do you want to DO?"

**Preventing complacency vs. creating anxiety:**
- High performers often fear that if they stop pushing, they'll regress
- This fear can drive productive behavior but also chronic stress, burnout, inability to enjoy success
- The healthy alternative: intrinsic motivation, process focus, growth-mindset without anxiety about outcome
- "Maintaining edge" prompts should be about curiosity and refinement, not fear and protection

**Dark triad risks with success:**
- Success correlates with increased narcissism, Machiavellianism, and (to lesser extent) psychopathy scores
- Mechanism: success provides confirming evidence for grandiose self-image, insulates from negative feedback, creates environments that reward manipulation
- Ethical reflection becomes more important, not less, as influence increases
- Review should include: "How did your actions affect others?" "What responsibility comes with your position?"

**Expert-level flow (Ericsson):**
- Flow requires challenge-skill balance — as skill increases, required challenge increases
- Experts who stop challenging themselves lose flow access → boredom, disengagement
- Deliberate practice principles: focus on weaknesses, seek feedback, push beyond comfort zone
- For high performers: the "new challenge" may be helping others, teaching, or domains of deliberate incompetence

**Post-achievement depression:**
- Well-documented in Olympic athletes, founders post-exit, authors post-publication
- The structure and meaning provided by pursuit disappears
- Prevention: identity diversification (not all identity in one achievement), process enjoyment (not just outcome focus), next-challenge pipeline
- Recovery: grief processing (yes, even for "success"), identity reconstruction, meaning-finding beyond achievement

**Gratitude calibration:**
- High performers can lose perspective on how rare their achievements are
- Comparison shifts to peer group (other high performers) → eternal insufficiency
- Calibrated gratitude: deliberately comparing to broader base, past self, possible selves who didn't succeed
- Not toxic positivity — realistic acknowledgment of good fortune alongside continued growth

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Create "success phase" template variants distinct from "development phase"
- Include arrival fallacy psychoeducation when users report achieving long-held goals
- Add "maintaining edge" prompts focused on curiosity and refinement rather than anxiety: "What's interesting to you about this now?" "Where are you still a beginner?"
- Include ethical reflection for those with influence: "How did your actions affect others this week?" "What responsibility comes with what you have?"
- Track identity flexibility: ensure identity isn't over-invested in achievement; prompt for multi-domain identity
- Gratitude calibration: "Compared to where you were 6 months ago..." "What would past-you think of this?"
- Watch for post-achievement depression signals: low ratings after major success, purposelessness language, compulsive goal escalation
- Help distinguish process enjoyment from outcome dependency: "Did you enjoy the doing, or just the result?"
- For abundance paralysis: decision-making support, permission to not optimize everything

### 29. Neurodivergent Considerations

**Sources:** Dodson, W.W. (2016) RSD in ADHD, *ADDitude Magazine* and clinical presentations; Barkley, R.A. (2015) *Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Handbook for Diagnosis and Treatment*, 4th ed.; Taylor, G.J. et al. (1997) *Disorders of Affect Regulation: Alexithymia in Medical and Psychiatric Illness*; Milton, D. (2012) double empathy problem, *Disability & Society*; Price, D. (2022) *Unmasking Autism*.

#### Key Findings

**ADHD-Specific Considerations:**

**Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD):**
- Intense emotional response to perceived rejection, criticism, or failure — not proportionate to actual event
- Estimated 99% of adults with ADHD report RSD experiences (Dodson)
- Key feature: emotional flooding that feels uncontrollable, visceral rather than cognitive
- RSD is NOT the same as standard rejection sensitivity — the intensity and physiological component are different
- Standard cognitive reframing ("They didn't mean it that way") doesn't work because the response is subcortical
- What helps: validation of the emotional experience, time for nervous system to regulate, recognition of pattern without shame, medication can help some
- Review implication: RSD rejection may look disproportionate → system must validate rather than correct

**Time blindness:**
- Difficulty perceiving time, estimating durations, connecting present actions to future consequences
- Affects review cadence: "weekly review" may not feel meaningfully different from "monthly"
- Standard "compare to last week" prompts may not land — last week doesn't feel connected to now
- What helps: visual representations of time, external cues for review timing, shorter review intervals (daily more relevant than weekly), concrete temporal anchors

**Executive function barriers:**
- Initiating tasks (including review), maintaining attention, working memory limitations, emotional regulation
- Standard friction reduction isn't enough — executive function barriers are more fundamental
- The review itself must be designed for EF constraints: minimal decisions, no switching between formats, immediate entry point
- "Do it when you feel like it" doesn't work — ADHD involves wanting to do things and being unable to initiate
- What helps: external accountability, body-doubling, time-anchored triggers (after dinner, not "in the evening"), momentum-based design (once started, keep going)

**Novelty needs:**
- ADHD brains are dopamine-seeking → novelty = dopamine = engagement
- Static review formats become boring fast → abandonment
- Rotating prompts, varied formats, occasional surprises can help maintain engagement
- But: too much novelty = overwhelm. Need "novel within structure" rather than constant reinvention

**Hyperfocus traps:**
- ADHD hyperfocus can turn tracking into obsessive data collection
- Hours spent on review design, spreadsheet optimization, "productive procrastination"
- The review becomes avoidance of actual practice
- What helps: time-bounded review sessions, explicit "this is enough" markers, watch for tracking becoming the project

**Autism-Specific Considerations:**

**Alexithymia:**
- Difficulty identifying and describing one's own emotions — estimated 50%+ of autistic adults
- Standard prompts like "How do you feel about that?" are functionally unanswerable
- Not absence of emotions — difficulty accessing/labeling them
- Taylor Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) can identify
- What helps: sensation-based prompts ("What do you notice in your body?"), external cues, multiple-choice rather than open-ended, pattern recognition over direct access

**Different (not deficit) emotional processing:**
- Autistic emotional experience is different, not less
- May process emotions on delay, experience intensity differently, have different triggers
- Neurotypical emotional frameworks don't necessarily apply
- Review prompts designed for neurotypical emotional processing may miss entirely
- What helps: personalized emotional vocabulary, validation of different processing patterns, time allowance

**Pattern recognition strengths:**
- Autistic individuals often excel at pattern recognition — a strength the review can leverage
- "What patterns do you notice?" may work better than "How do you feel?"
- Data visualization and trend analysis may be more engaging than narrative reflection
- The review can be reframed as systematic analysis rather than emotional processing

**Social script vs. authenticity tension:**
- Many autistic people navigate social situations via learned scripts
- Review prompts about "authentic expression" may conflict with script-based social survival
- Rejection in social contexts may be about script failure rather than personal rejection
- What helps: prompts that acknowledge scripts as valid tools, separate "script improvement" from "authentic self" domains

**Masking exhaustion:**
- "Masking" = suppressing autistic traits to appear neurotypical
- Masking is exhausting and has mental health costs
- Energy levels in review may reflect masking load, not just activity load
- What helps: "How much masking did today require?" as an energy factor, permission to unmask during review

**Sensory and energy management:**
- Sensory sensitivities and energy management are often underweighted
- What appears as "motivation" issue may be sensory or energy depletion
- Review should track sensory load and energy as distinct dimensions

**Both/General:**

**Standard research caveats:**
- Most psychological research used neurotypical samples (often WEIRD: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic)
- Effect sizes and intervention effectiveness may not replicate in ND populations
- "Evidence-based" doesn't mean "evidence-based for everyone"
- What helps: explicit acknowledgment that adaptation may be needed, don't assume techniques that work for NTs will transfer

**Masking across neurotypes:**
- Both ADHD and autistic individuals often mask their differences
- Masking consumes energy, increases anxiety, and interferes with authentic self-expression
- Review prompts should create space for unmasked reflection

**Strengths-based framing:**
- Deficit framing ("disorder," "dysfunction") has psychological costs
- ND traits often include genuine strengths (creativity, pattern recognition, hyperfocus, deep interests, different perspectives)
- Review should identify and leverage strengths, not just accommodate deficits

**When "just do the technique" fails:**
- Standard advice assumes a baseline of executive function, emotional access, and neurotypical processing
- For ND users, the "just" in "just do X" may be the entire problem
- What helps: breaking techniques into smaller steps, alternative entry points, acknowledging the barrier rather than pushing through it

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Offer ADHD-adapted template variants:
  - Shorter (novelty-seeking means attention wanders)
  - Variable prompts (rotation to maintain dopamine interest)
  - No time-blindness assumptions (don't reference "last week" abstractly)
  - Momentum-based design (once started, minimize switching)
  - Time-boxed explicitly ("This takes 3 minutes max")
- Offer autism-adapted template variants:
  - More structure, less open-ended
  - Sensation-based alternatives to emotion-word prompts
  - Pattern recognition framing ("What patterns do you notice?")
  - Option to skip emotional labeling entirely
  - Energy/sensory tracking as first-class fields
- Add RSD-specific processing:
  - Validate intensity before attempting reframe
  - "That sounds really painful" before "Was it really rejection?"
  - Time for nervous system regulation before analysis
- Create alexithymia workarounds:
  - "What sensations do you notice?" instead of "How do you feel?"
  - Multiple-choice emotion options rather than open text
  - Body-based entry points
- Add masking exhaustion as a trackable factor
- Include strengths identification prompts, not just challenge/growth prompts
- Explicit "this is enough" markers to prevent hyperfocus tracking traps
- Watch for tracking becoming avoidance — prompt if review time dramatically exceeds guidelines
- Option to use data visualization / pattern view instead of narrative reflection

### 30. Clinical Safety — Detection & Referral

**Sources:** Suicide prevention safe messaging guidelines (AFSP, SAVE, Reporting on Suicide); PHQ-9 screening awareness (Kroenke et al., 2001); APA Guidelines for therapy referral; SAMHSA TIP 62 on trauma-informed care; ICF coaching vs. therapy scope distinctions; Jobes, D.A. (2016) *Managing Suicidal Risk: A Collaborative Approach*.

#### Key Findings

**Warning signs to detect:**

**Sustained hopelessness vs. temporary discouragement:**
- Temporary discouragement: "Today was hard," "I'm struggling with this," bad days interspersed with okay days
- Sustained hopelessness: "Nothing will ever work," "What's the point," consistent low ratings over 2+ weeks, future-oriented negativity ("I don't see this getting better")
- Key difference: temporary discouragement maintains future orientation; sustained hopelessness does not
- Detection: track language patterns over time, watch for loss of future-oriented statements, persistent low ratings

**Social withdrawal patterns:**
- Decreasing mention of social contact in reviews
- "I didn't see anyone" becoming pattern rather than exception
- Declining social activities that were previously sources of support
- Social withdrawal is a risk factor for depression, suicidality, and overall decline
- Detection: track social activity mentions, alert on declining trend

**Crisis language indicators:**
- Passive suicidality: "I wish I wasn't here," "Everyone would be better off without me," "I don't see a future"
- Active indicators: mention of means, specific plans, giving away possessions, sudden calm after prolonged distress
- This system should NOT attempt to assess or screen — only detect language patterns that warrant professional evaluation
- Detection: keyword and pattern matching for crisis language, immediate prompt for professional contact

**When review prompts trigger despair not growth:**
- Expected: review prompts surface difficulty, then lead to processing/learning
- Warning sign: review prompts consistently trigger downward spiral, user is worse off after review than before
- The review system should help, not harm — if it's causing harm, it should recognize this
- Detection: pre/post review state comparison, patterns of abandoning review mid-session with lower state

**Functional impairment indicators:**
- Difficulty with basic tasks: sleep, eating, hygiene, work, relationships
- "I couldn't get out of bed," "I haven't showered," "I missed work again"
- Functional impairment indicates severity beyond what self-guided tools can address
- Detection: watch for mentions of basic function decline

**When to refer out:**

**Clear scope language:**
- "This review system is designed to support growth and reflection. It is NOT a substitute for professional mental health care."
- Users should know from the start: this is a tool for people who are fundamentally okay and want to improve, not a treatment for clinical conditions
- Scope clarity prevents unrealistic expectations and protects vulnerable users

**Signs that coaching-level intervention is insufficient:**
- Symptoms of clinical depression (sustained low mood, anhedonia, sleep/appetite changes, hopelessness)
- Anxiety interfering with daily function
- Trauma responses being triggered by review content
- Suicidal ideation of any kind
- Substance use to cope
- Relationship violence or abuse situations

**How to suggest professional help without stigmatizing:**
- Normalize help-seeking: "Many people find it helpful to talk with a therapist when going through something like this"
- Frame positively: "A therapist could give you more support than this app can"
- Make it easy: provide concrete resources, not just "seek help"
- Avoid: pathologizing language, making user feel "broken," suggesting failure for needing help

**What NOT to do:**

**Don't attempt crisis intervention:**
- A review system is not trained to handle crisis
- Attempting intervention could cause harm
- Role is detection and referral, not treatment
- If crisis detected: provide resources, encourage immediate contact with trained professional, do NOT attempt to talk them through it

**Don't provide screening tools:**
- Screening tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7, etc.) are clinical instruments requiring proper context
- Including them creates impression of clinical service
- Users may self-diagnose based on scores
- Exception: could include validated wellness tools (not diagnostic) with appropriate framing

**Don't promise therapeutic outcomes:**
- Marketing/copy should never imply this system treats depression, anxiety, trauma
- "Feel better" is acceptable; "treat depression" is not
- Regulatory and ethical line between wellness and healthcare

**Safe messaging guidelines:**

**Suicide prevention best practices (from reporting guidelines):**
- Don't describe methods or means
- Don't present suicide as an understandable response to problems
- Don't glorify or romanticize
- DO include help resources every time topic comes up
- DO emphasize that help is available and suicidal crises are temporary
- DO frame seeking help as strength

**Resource provision:**
- Include crisis resources in accessible location (not buried)
- International and local resources
- Text-based options (Crisis Text Line) for those who won't call
- Normalize using resources: "Many people contact these services — you're not alone"

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Update S3 Contraindications with specific detection criteria from above
- Add "This system is for [growth/reflection], if you're experiencing [sustained distress/crisis], please seek [professional support]" framing to onboarding and accessible help
- Persistent low ratings (2+ weeks of 1-2) → gentle professional help suggestion: "It sounds like things have been hard lately. Have you considered talking with a therapist or counselor? [Resources]"
- Clear scope boundaries in user-facing copy: what this is and isn't for
- Build detection for: sustained hopelessness language, social withdrawal pattern, crisis language, functional impairment mentions
- Response to detection: NOT intervention, but caring redirect: "What you're describing sounds really hard. This app can support reflection, but [resource] can provide more help."
- Include crisis resources in persistent accessible location
- Template 7 (crisis/contraindicated) becomes the response path when clinical signals detected
- Never ask "Are you thinking of hurting yourself?" — that's clinical screening, not our scope
- DO ask "Would you like some resources for extra support right now?" — framing as additional support, not diagnosis
- Review system should track its own impact: if reviews correlate with worsening state, prompt reconsideration of review itself

### 31. Motivation Type Variations

**Sources:** McClelland, D.C. (1987) *Human Motivation*, Cambridge University Press; Elliot, A.J. & Harackiewicz, J.M. (1996) approach and avoidance achievement goals, *JPSP*; Dweck, C.S. (1986) motivational processes affecting learning, *American Psychologist*; Vallerand, R.J. et al. (2003) dualistic model of passion, *JPSP*; Loewenstein, G. (1994) psychology of curiosity, *Psychological Bulletin*; Kashdan, T.B. et al. (2018) five-dimensional curiosity scale, *JPSP*; Sheldon, K.M. & Elliot, A.J. (1999) goal striving and need satisfaction, *JPSP*.

#### Key Findings

**Murray/McClelland's Three Motivation Types:**
- **Achievement motivation (nAch)**: Driven by accomplishment, mastery, excellence. These users want to improve skills, hit metrics, see tangible progress. They respond well to concrete goals, measurable outcomes, and competence-tracking prompts.
- **Affiliation motivation (nAff)**: Driven by connection, belonging, relationships. These users care more about social bonds than personal achievement. "How many approaches?" matters less than "How connected did I feel?" They may feel alienated by purely achievement-focused metrics.
- **Power motivation (nPow)**: Driven by influence, status, impact. These users want to affect others, lead, be respected. Success metrics include social proof, perceived status, and influence over outcomes.
- Key insight: Standard review prompts assume achievement motivation. Telling an affiliation-motivated person "You achieved X this week" misses their actual satisfaction source (connection). Different motivation profiles need fundamentally different success definitions and review prompts.

**Approach vs. Avoidance Motivation (Elliot):**
- **Approach motivation**: Moving toward positive outcomes — "I want to get better," "I want to connect with interesting people," "I want to feel confident."
- **Avoidance motivation**: Moving away from negative outcomes — "I don't want to be lonely," "I don't want to feel like a failure," "I don't want to regret not trying."
- Effect on persistence: Approach motivation sustains effort through setbacks better; avoidance motivation creates anxiety and defensive processing.
- Effect on learning: Approach orientation facilitates open exploration; avoidance orientation narrows attention to threats.
- Review implication: Prompts can be framed in approach terms ("What did you move toward?") or avoidance terms ("What did you avoid that you shouldn't have?"). Match the user's default orientation initially, then gradually shift toward approach framing for long-term wellbeing.

**Mastery vs. Performance Goals (Dweck, Elliot & Harackiewicz):**
- **Mastery goals**: Focus on learning, improvement, skill development. "Am I getting better?" Success = growth, regardless of comparison to others.
- **Performance goals**: Focus on demonstrating ability, comparison to others. "Am I better than others?" Success = favorable comparison.
- Four-cell model:
  - *Mastery-approach*: "I want to learn and improve" (healthiest for sustained engagement)
  - *Mastery-avoidance*: "I don't want to lose my skills" (common in experts fearing decline)
  - *Performance-approach*: "I want to outperform others" (can motivate but creates anxiety)
  - *Performance-avoidance*: "I don't want to look incompetent" (most likely to quit after setbacks)
- Response to failure: Mastery-oriented users interpret failure as feedback and persist; performance-oriented users interpret failure as evidence of inadequacy and may quit or avoid challenge.
- Review implication: For mastery-oriented users, emphasize learning and skill trajectories. For performance-oriented users (who are common in competitive domains), gradually shift prompts toward mastery framing to build resilience.

**Vallerand's Dualistic Model of Passion:**
- **Harmonious passion**: Activity is integrated with identity but doesn't dominate it. Engagement is flexible and autonomous. Person can disengage without distress. Associated with positive outcomes: flow, positive affect, healthy relationships.
- **Obsessive passion**: Activity controls the person, not vice versa. Engagement is rigid and compulsive. Person feels they *must* do it, experiences distress when prevented. Associated with negative outcomes: rumination, conflict, burnout, persistence even when harmful.
- Warning signs of obsessive passion: Inability to take breaks without guilt/anxiety, relationship conflicts due to activity prioritization, continuing despite diminishing returns or harm, identity collapse when activity is unavailable.
- The pursuit itself (dating, approaches, self-improvement) can become obsessive passion. The review system should detect this and not inadvertently feed it.
- Review implication: Include prompts that check for healthy engagement vs. compulsion. "Could you take a week off without distress?" "Does this feel like choice or compulsion?" Watch for obsessive passion indicators and intervene with balance-oriented prompts.

**Curiosity as Specific Intrinsic Motivation (Loewenstein, Kashdan):**
- **Information gap theory**: Curiosity arises when we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know. Partial knowledge increases curiosity; complete ignorance or complete knowledge reduces it.
- **Five dimensions of curiosity** (Kashdan): Joyous exploration (delight in new), deprivation sensitivity (need to reduce uncertainty), stress tolerance (willingness to embrace anxiety of unknown), social curiosity (interest in others), thrill seeking (willingness to take risks for novelty).
- Different curiosity profiles need different prompts: High joyous exploration → "What surprised you?"; High deprivation sensitivity → "What questions do you still have?"; High social curiosity → "What did you learn about someone?"
- Curiosity as review fuel: Prompts that spark curiosity ("What would happen if...?") drive engagement better than obligation prompts ("You should reflect on...").
- Review implication: Leverage curiosity to drive reflection. Use information-gap framing ("What do you still not understand about what happened?"). Different curiosity profiles respond to different prompts.

**Self-Concordance Theory (Sheldon & Elliot):**
- Goals can be pursued for different reasons:
  - *External*: "Others expect me to" — lowest concordance
  - *Introjected*: "I'd feel guilty if I didn't" — low concordance
  - *Identified*: "It's important to me personally" — high concordance
  - *Intrinsic*: "I find it enjoyable and interesting" — highest concordance
- Self-concordant goals → more effort invested → more likely to attain → more wellbeing from attainment.
- Non-concordant goals → even successful attainment doesn't satisfy. "I did everything right but I still feel empty."
- This explains why some users achieve their stated goals but remain dissatisfied: the goals weren't authentically theirs.
- Review implication: Include self-concordance checks. "Why are you pursuing this? What would happen if you stopped?" Surface external vs. intrinsic motivation. Help users distinguish their authentic goals from introjected "shoulds."

**Motivation Profile Stability vs. Change:**
- Motivation types are relatively stable traits but can shift with intervention and context.
- Life events can shift motivation: relationship loss may temporarily increase affiliation motivation; achievement may temporarily satisfy and shift focus elsewhere.
- The review system should track motivation profile over time, not assume it's fixed.

#### DESIGN_IMPLICATION
- Add motivation type as a personalization dimension in S2: achievement/affiliation/power balance, approach/avoidance orientation, mastery/performance goal orientation
- Create motivation-matched prompts:
  - For nAch (achievement): "What skills improved?" "What metrics moved?" "What did you accomplish?"
  - For nAff (affiliation): "Who did you connect with?" "What relationships deepened?" "Where did you feel belonging?"
  - For nPow (power): "Where did you have impact?" "How did you influence outcomes?" "What respect did you earn?"
- Approach vs. avoidance prompt variants: Default to approach framing ("What did you move toward?") but detect avoidance-oriented users and meet them where they are before shifting
- Mastery vs. performance reframing: For performance-oriented users experiencing failure, explicitly reframe toward mastery ("What did this teach you?") to prevent dropout
- Obsessive passion detection: If user shows compulsion indicators (guilt about breaks, rigid engagement, identity fusion), prompt for balance and flexibility. Don't inadvertently feed obsession with more tracking.
- Curiosity-driven prompts: Use information-gap framing ("What questions emerged?"). Leverage specific curiosity dimensions based on user profile.
- Self-concordance check (weekly/monthly): "Why are you doing this? Would you continue if no one was watching?" Help users distinguish authentic motivation from introjected shoulds.
- Track motivation profile evolution over time — it's not static

## Structural Design Sections

---

### S1. Data Flow Map: Field Reports → Daily Reviews → Weekly Reviews

**Purpose:** Explicitly design how per-session data feeds into daily reviews, and how daily data aggregates into weekly patterns. This integration was implied throughout the research but never explicitly designed.

#### The Three-Layer Architecture

```
Layer 1: FIELD REPORTS (per-session, real-time)
  ↓ auto-aggregated
Layer 2: DAILY REVIEWS (end-of-day, processing)
  ↓ auto-aggregated
Layer 3: WEEKLY REVIEWS (pattern recognition, strategic)
```

#### Layer 1 → Layer 2: Session Data → Daily Review

**What flows up automatically:**
- Number of sessions today
- Session RPE ratings → daily average
- Key emotions logged → emotion frequency for the day
- Highlights/lowlights → auto-populated for daily review confirmation
- Skills practiced → daily skill summary

**What the daily review ADDS (not in session data):**
- Overall day rating (holistic, not just sessions)
- Non-session context (sleep, energy, life events)
- End-of-day emotional state (may differ from in-session emotions)
- Tomorrow's intention (forward-looking)
- Inner critic observations (meta-level, not session-specific)

**Design principle:** The daily review should PRE-POPULATE from session data and ask the user to confirm/adjust, not re-enter. "You logged 3 sessions today with an average energy of 3.5. Does that feel right?"

#### Layer 2 → Layer 3: Daily Data → Weekly Review

**What flows up automatically:**
- Days active / total days
- Daily ratings → trend line + average
- Energy/mood trends → weekly trajectory
- Cumulative session count and volume
- Emotion frequency map (which emotions showed up most this week)
- Daily highlights → "pick your top moment" for weekly reflection

**What the weekly review ADDS (not in daily data):**
- Pattern recognition: "I notice you rated higher on days you practiced in the morning"
- Strategic assessment: "Your volume is up 30% from last week — is that sustainable?"
- Blocker analysis: "The same obstacle appeared 3 times this week — let's address it"
- Identity/values reflection (too abstract for daily)
- Goal recalibration and next-week commitment

**Design principle:** The weekly review starts with a dashboard of auto-aggregated daily data. The user reviews DATA first, then reflects. Data anchors the remembering self (section 7).

#### Integration Rules

1. **Never ask users to re-enter data** that exists at a lower layer
2. **Always surface anomalies**: "Your Tuesday rating was much lower than your average — anything going on?"
3. **Progressive summarization**: raw data (session) → daily summary → weekly patterns → monthly themes
4. **Bidirectional enrichment**: weekly insights should annotate/tag daily entries retroactively ("This was the turning point week")

---

### S2. Personalization Framework / User Archetypes

**Purpose:** Different users at different stages with different psychological profiles need different review experiences. One-size-fits-all templates fail to serve the diversity of users.

#### Personalization Dimensions

**1. Experience Level (temporal)**
| Stage | Duration | Review Focus | Prompt Style |
|---|---|---|---|
| Newcomer | Month 1-2 | Emotional regulation, habit building, basic tracking | Warm, simple, lots of validation |
| Developing | Month 3-6 | Pattern recognition, skill development, deeper reflection | More analytical, introduce scaling |
| Experienced | Month 6-12 | Strategic optimization, identity integration, mentoring | Complex prompts, advanced frameworks |
| Veteran | 12+ months | Maintenance, teaching others, philosophy | Minimal structure, journaling, wisdom |

**2. Psychological Profile (personality-based)**
| Profile | Risk | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| High neuroticism | Rumination, self-criticism spirals | More soothing prompts, guardrails against over-analysis, shorter reviews, emphasis on observation over evaluation |
| High conscientiousness | Perfectionism, burnout, rigid tracking | Deload reminders, flexible targets, "good enough" framing, permission to skip |
| Low conscientiousness | Inconsistency, abandoning reviews | Ultra-low friction, more gamification (carefully), accountability features |
| High openness | Boredom with routine, desire for novelty | Rotating prompts, varied formats, creative exercises |
| Introverted | Social energy depletion | Less emphasis on social metrics, more internal reflection |

**3. Current Emotional State (dynamic)**
- Detected through: nervous system state check (section 22), recent daily ratings, language patterns
- Adapts session-by-session, not just at onboarding

**4. Stage of Change (motivational)**
- Detected through: MI-style assessment (section 25), engagement patterns, language analysis
- Adapts the review's motivational approach

**5. Attachment Style (relational)**
| Style | Prevalence | Risk Patterns | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Secure | ~55% | Generally healthy processing | Standard templates work well |
| Anxious/Preoccupied | ~20% | Rumination on rejection, reassurance-seeking, difficulty letting go | Guard against analysis loops, emphasize present moment, prompts for other relationships, avoid "what went wrong" analysis |
| Avoidant/Dismissive | ~25% | Emotion suppression, premature "moving on," intellectualization | Gently invite emotional access, validate that feeling is okay, watch for delayed grief emergence |
| Fearful-Avoidant/Disorganized | ~5% | Volatile swings between pursuit and withdrawal, crisis risk | High-support templates, frequent state checks, shorter sessions, easy crisis resource access |

- Detected through: onboarding assessment (ECR-R short form), behavioral patterns (rumination vs. avoidance after rejection), explicit user identification
- Especially relevant during heartbreak/rejection processing — different styles need fundamentally different prompts
- See Section #27 for detailed attachment style guidance

**6. Neurodivergence (cognitive)**
| Type | Key Considerations | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| ADHD | Time blindness, RSD, executive function barriers, novelty-seeking | Shorter variable prompts, no abstract time references, momentum-based design, time-boxed explicitly |
| Autism | Alexithymia, different emotional processing, pattern recognition strengths | Sensation-based prompts, skip emotional labeling option, more structure, leverage pattern analysis |
| Both/Combined | Masking exhaustion, strengths-based framing needed | Energy/sensory tracking, explicit "enough" markers, data visualization options |

- Detected through: user self-identification (primary), behavioral patterns (RSD indicators, prompt abandonment patterns)
- See Section #29 for detailed neurodivergent considerations

**7. Success Phase (developmental)**
| Phase | Characteristics | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| Developing | Working toward goals, skill building | Standard growth-oriented templates |
| Succeeding | Achieving consistent results | Success-phase templates, arrival fallacy awareness, ethical reflection |
| Post-achievement | Major goal achieved, potential emptiness | Identity flexibility prompts, gratitude calibration, purpose exploration |

- Detected through: user-reported outcomes, goal achievement tracking, language patterns (purposelessness, "now what?")
- See Section #28 for high performer psychology

**8. Motivation Type (motivational)**
| Type | Core Drive | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| Achievement (nAch) | Accomplishment, mastery, excellence | Metrics-focused prompts, skill tracking, competence emphasis |
| Affiliation (nAff) | Connection, belonging, relationships | Connection-focused prompts, relationship quality tracking, belonging emphasis |
| Power (nPow) | Influence, status, impact | Impact-focused prompts, social proof tracking, influence emphasis |

| Orientation | Pattern | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| Approach | Moving toward positive outcomes | "What did you move toward?" framing, growth emphasis |
| Avoidance | Moving away from negative outcomes | Meet where they are, gradually shift toward approach framing |
| Mastery | Focus on learning and improvement | Learning-focused prompts, process over outcome |
| Performance | Focus on comparison to others | Acknowledge but reframe toward mastery after setbacks |

- Detected through: onboarding assessment, behavioral patterns (what prompts resonate, what gets skipped), language analysis (connection vs achievement language)
- Watch for: obsessive passion indicators (compulsion, guilt about breaks, rigid engagement)
- See Section #31 for detailed motivation type guidance

#### Archetype Examples

**"The Anxious Beginner"** (high neuroticism, newcomer, contemplation stage):
- Ultra-short reviews (one-tap only for first weeks)
- Heavy soothing system activation
- No evaluative prompts until month 2
- Frequent normalization: "Most people feel this way at first"
- ACT defusion prompts over CBT challenge prompts

**"The Driven Optimizer"** (high conscientiousness, experienced, action stage):
- Full analytical dashboard welcome
- BUT: include mandatory deload check, "are you over-tracking?" prompts
- Balance drive with soothing: end every review with contentment, not just next goals
- Watch for burnout indicators

**"The Inconsistent Explorer"** (low conscientiousness, high openness, developing):
- Varied prompt formats to prevent boredom
- Lower bar for "completion" — any engagement counts
- Flexible streaks, no guilt for gaps
- Novel frameworks and creative exercises to maintain interest

**"The Heartbroken Anxious"** (anxious attachment, newcomer/developing, high neuroticism):
- Heartbreak protocol template (soothing over learning)
- Heavy guard against rumination — don't ask "what went wrong"
- Prompts for other relationships and secure base building
- Grief-phase detection — loss-orientation vs. restoration-orientation prompts
- Watch for limerence patterns; provide psychoeducation if detected

**"The ADHD High Performer"** (ADHD, experienced, action stage, high conscientiousness):
- Shorter, variable prompts to maintain novelty
- Explicit time-boxing ("3 minutes max")
- Watch for hyperfocus tracking trap
- RSD-aware rejection processing — validate intensity before reframe
- Success-phase awareness once achieving results
- Momentum-based design — minimal switching once started

**"The Autistic Analyzer"** (autism, developing, high openness):
- Pattern recognition framing ("What patterns do you notice?")
- Sensation-based rather than emotion-word prompts
- Option to skip emotional labeling entirely
- Data visualization and trend analysis emphasis
- More structure, less open-ended
- Energy/sensory tracking as key dimensions

**"The Successful Avoidant"** (avoidant attachment, experienced, success phase):
- Success-phase templates with ethical reflection
- Gently invite emotional access despite success
- Watch for "moving on" as avoidance
- Gratitude calibration prompts
- Identity flexibility — not over-invested in achievement
- Prompts for relationship quality alongside results

**"The Affiliation-Driven Newcomer"** (nAff motivation, newcomer, approach orientation):
- Connection-focused metrics over achievement metrics
- "Who did you connect with?" over "How many approaches?"
- Belonging and relationship quality prompts
- Social support tracking as primary dimension
- De-emphasize performance comparison
- Frame progress in relational terms ("You're building connections")

**"The Performance-Avoidant Staller"** (performance goals, avoidance orientation, developing):
- High risk of dropout after setbacks (interprets failure as inadequacy)
- Explicit mastery reframing: "What did you learn?" not "How did you compare?"
- Validate fear of looking incompetent, then redirect
- Gradual shift from performance to mastery framing
- Lower stakes framing ("experiments" not "attempts")
- Watch for avoidance behaviors and address directly

#### Implementation Approach
- Initial archetype detection through onboarding questionnaire (5-7 questions)
- Ongoing adaptation through behavioral signals (completion rates, response patterns, emotional indicators)
- User can override at any time ("Show me more" / "This is too much")

---

### S3. Contraindications: When NOT to Review

**Purpose:** For certain people in certain states, forced structured reflection can be harmful. The system must detect this and respond appropriately.

#### When Structured Review Is Harmful

**1. Active rumination state:**
- Signs: circular thinking, repeatedly returning to the same event, inability to gain new perspective, increasing distress with each review cycle
- The review structure, which asks "What happened? How do you feel? What does it mean?" can FEED rumination rather than resolve it
- Response: interrupt the cycle. Offer grounding exercises, behavioral activation ("Go do something different"), or simple permission to stop

**2. Shame spiral:**
- Signs: global self-criticism ("I'm a failure" vs. "I failed at this"), withdrawal from the review itself, avoidance of specifics
- Evaluative review prompts (even gentle ones) can deepen shame
- Response: shift to pure observation mode, soothing system activation, normalize the experience, or suggest taking a break from reviews

**3. Dorsal vagal shutdown (section 22):**
- Signs: emotional numbness, "I don't care," flatness, disconnection, very short/empty responses
- Structured reflection requires ventral vagal engagement. In shutdown, the user cannot access the cognitive resources needed for meaningful review
- Response: co-regulation first (warmth, safety, connection), then simple sensory prompts ("What's one thing you can see/hear/touch right now?"), NOT analytical review

**4. Acute distress / crisis:**
- Signs: extreme emotion ratings, crisis language, indication of self-harm thoughts
- A review system is NOT a crisis intervention tool
- Response: immediate redirection to appropriate resources (crisis lines, therapist contact), NOT review prompts

**5. Tracking burnout (section 12):**
- Signs: tracking becomes a guilt-source, missing a day causes disproportionate anxiety, entries are rote/formulaic, data is collected but never reviewed
- Continuing to review amplifies the problem
- Response: suggest a "tracking vacation" (1-2 weeks off), reduce to minimum viable (one tap only), reset expectations

**6. Clinical-level distress (section 30):**
- This system is designed for growth and reflection, NOT as a substitute for professional mental health care
- Signs requiring professional referral:
  - **Sustained hopelessness**: 2+ weeks of persistent "nothing will ever work," "what's the point," future-oriented negativity (distinct from temporary discouragement which maintains future orientation)
  - **Social withdrawal pattern**: decreasing mention of social contact, declining previously supportive activities
  - **Crisis language**: passive suicidality ("I wish I wasn't here"), active indicators (means, plans), giving away possessions, sudden calm after prolonged distress
  - **Functional impairment**: difficulty with basic tasks (sleep, eating, hygiene, work), "I couldn't get out of bed" becoming pattern
  - **Review triggers despair**: review prompts consistently trigger downward spiral rather than processing — user worse off after review than before
- What this system should NOT do:
  - Attempt crisis intervention (not trained for it)
  - Provide screening tools (PHQ-9 etc. are clinical instruments)
  - Promise therapeutic outcomes
  - Ask "Are you thinking of hurting yourself?" (clinical screening, not our scope)
- Response: caring redirect, not intervention
  - "What you're describing sounds really hard. This app can support reflection, but a therapist can provide more help."
  - "Would you like some resources for extra support right now?"
  - Provide crisis resources (always accessible, not buried)
  - Route to Template 7 (crisis/contraindicated state)

**7. Attachment wound activation (section 27):**
- Signs: emotional intensity disproportionate to relationship length/depth, familiar pattern ("this always happens"), regression to childlike emotional states, present rejection activating early abandonment wounds
- Standard review prompts can retraumatize if they encourage re-exposure without support
- Response: switch to soothing/stabilization mode, avoid "what went wrong" analysis, grief-appropriate prompts, suggest professional support if intensity persists

**8. Neurodivergent mismatch (section 29):**
- Signs for ADHD: consistent abandonment of reviews mid-way, time reference prompts not landing, RSD responses to gentle prompts
- Signs for autism: emotion-word prompts consistently blank or formulaic, obvious discomfort with open-ended reflection
- Standard templates may actively harm engagement by creating repeated failure experiences
- Response: switch to ND-adapted templates, offer sensation-based alternatives, reduce cognitive load, honor different processing styles

#### Scope Statement (Display to Users)

**This system is for:**
- People who are fundamentally okay and want to improve
- Reflection and growth support
- Building self-awareness and skills
- Processing normal challenges and setbacks

**This system is NOT for:**
- Treatment of clinical depression, anxiety, trauma, or other mental health conditions
- Crisis intervention
- Substitute for professional therapy or counseling
- Diagnostic assessment

**If you're experiencing sustained distress, please reach out:**
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US)
- International Association for Suicide Prevention: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/
- Or contact a mental health professional in your area

#### The "Safe Exit" Design

Every review should have:
1. **An easy out**: "Not today" button that is ALWAYS visible, never buried
2. **No guilt**: "Taking a break is fine. We'll be here when you're ready."
3. **A check-in alternative**: "Instead of reviewing, would you like to [do a breathing exercise / listen to something calming / just note that you showed up]?"
4. **Automatic detection**: if 3+ daily reviews are skipped or abandoned mid-way, offer a meta-prompt: "Reviews seem hard lately. Would you like to simplify, pause, or talk about what's going on?"

#### Detection Signals

| Signal | Possible State | System Response |
|---|---|---|
| 3+ days of ratings at 1-2 | Sustained low mood | Offer simplified review + "Would you like to talk to someone?" |
| 2+ weeks of ratings at 1-2 | Potential clinical depression | Gentle professional help suggestion + crisis resources |
| Abandoned reviews (started but not finished) | Review resistance | Reduce review length, check for shame/burnout |
| Very short/identical entries | Formulaic compliance | "It seems like these prompts aren't landing. Want to try a different format?" |
| Escalating negative language | Rumination or crisis | Interrupt pattern, offer grounding, check in |
| Sudden stop after consistent use | Possible burnout or life event | Gentle reach-out after 3 days: "No pressure — just checking in" |
| Hopelessness language ("nothing will work," "what's the point") | Sustained hopelessness | Route to Template 7, suggest professional support, provide resources |
| Decreasing social mentions over 2+ weeks | Social withdrawal | "Have you been able to connect with anyone lately?" + resources |
| Crisis language (passive/active suicidality indicators) | Crisis state | Immediate Template 7, crisis resources prominently displayed, do NOT attempt intervention |
| Functional impairment mentions ("can't get out of bed") | Clinical-level distress | Validate + professional referral suggestion |
| User worse after review than before (state drops) | Review causing harm | Pause review suggestion, offer grounding only, reassess approach |
| Intensity disproportionate to described situation | Attachment wound activation | Switch to heartbreak protocol, soothing over analysis |
| Emotion prompts consistently blank (autism pattern) | Prompt mismatch | Offer sensation-based or pattern-based alternatives |
| Consistent mid-review abandonment (ADHD pattern) | Executive function barrier | Offer shorter/variable templates, explicit time-boxing |

### S4. Longitudinal Evolution: How the Review System Matures Over Time

**Purpose:** The review system itself should evolve alongside the user over 3, 6, 12+ months. Habit graduation (section 18) addressed format evolution (one tap → full review). This section addresses CONTENT evolution.

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
**Focus:** Emotional regulation, habit building, basic self-awareness

**Review content emphasis:**
- Emotional labeling (basic vocabulary, building granularity)
- Nervous system state awareness
- Simple tracking (did I practice? how do I feel?)
- Normalization of difficulty
- ACT defusion and willingness
- Soothing system activation (CFT)

**What's NOT included yet:**
- Complex pattern analysis (not enough data)
- Identity/values deep work (premature)
- Strategic optimization (nothing to optimize yet)

**Success metric:** User completes 60%+ of reviews, emotional vocabulary is expanding, can identify nervous system states

#### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Months 3-6)
**Focus:** Seeing patterns, connecting dots, developing personal theories

**Review content ADDS:**
- Weekly pattern analysis: "What conditions predict your best days?"
- SFBT scaling with trend tracking
- Blocker inventory and recurring obstacle analysis
- Decision quality tracking (process vs. outcome)
- Challenge-skill calibration (flow)
- Introduction of values exploration

**What's NOT included yet:**
- Deep identity work (still developing baseline)
- Teaching/mentoring frameworks

**Success metric:** User can identify 3+ patterns in their data, has extracted at least one "personal principle," shows improved emotional granularity

#### Phase 3: Strategic Optimization (Months 6-12)
**Focus:** Refined strategy, identity integration, deeper meaning

**Review content ADDS:**
- Identity-based reflection: "Who am I becoming?"
- Values Bull's Eye assessment
- Advanced periodization (mesocycle planning)
- Shattered assumptions tracking (belief system evolution)
- Pre-mortem analysis
- Confidence calibration tracking
- "Chapter" framing (narrative identity)

**Success metric:** User has a personal operating system emerging (principles, strategies, self-knowledge), can self-correct without prompts

#### Phase 4: Mastery & Integration (12+ months)
**Focus:** Minimal structure, wisdom, giving back

**Review content SHIFTS:**
- Reduced structure: user designs their own review
- Philosophical reflection: meaning, purpose, legacy
- Mentoring prompts: "What would you tell yourself 6 months ago?"
- System audit: "Which parts of the review are still useful?"
- Seasonal/quarterly deep reviews replace weekly detail
- "Graduation" milestones: some tracking dimensions retire as they become automatic

**Success metric:** User maintains practice with minimal system support, generates own insights, potentially mentors others

#### Evolution Mechanics

1. **Content unlocking**: new prompt types unlock based on usage duration + engagement quality (not just time elapsed)
2. **Prompt retirement**: prompts that consistently get skipped or receive formulaic answers are deprioritized
3. **Periodic resets**: every 3 months, offer a "review of the review" — which parts are working? What should change?
4. **User agency**: users can always access any level's content. Evolution is the default, not a gate.

## Synthesized Design Principles

Drawing from all 31 research domains plus 4 structural sections, these are the cross-cutting principles that appeared consistently:

### Principle 1: Observation Before Evaluation
**Sources:** Contemplative practices (#13), Inner Game (#11), Time Perspective (#16), CBT (#5)

The default mode should be "What did you notice?" not "How did you do?" Observation has lower cognitive load, higher sustainability, and avoids reinforcing self-criticism. Evaluation is opt-in and secondary.

### Principle 2: Structure Over Freedom
**Sources:** Journaling meta-analyses (#20), Self-coaching research (#11), DBT (#5), Time Perspective (#16)

Structured prompts consistently outperform open-ended reflection. Unstructured journaling risks rumination for past-negative individuals and shallow compliance for present-hedonistic ones. The prompts ARE the intervention.

### Principle 3: Pain Before Growth
**Sources:** Meaning-making (#19), Benefit finding (#19), Contemplative (#13), Narrative psychology (#8)

Always process difficulty before exploring benefits. Premature positivity is toxic. Sequence: acknowledge -> feel -> examine -> extract (optionally). "I'm still processing" is always valid.

### Principle 4: Past-Positive First
**Sources:** Time Perspective (#16), Behavioral economics (#7), Positive psychology (#2), Contemplative (#13)

Start every review with appreciation, gratitude, or strengths. This activates the past-positive memory network before past-negative can dominate. It counteracts negativity bias (3x impact of negative events) and prevents reviews from becoming deficit audits.

### Principle 5: Input Metrics Over Output Metrics
**Sources:** Org learning (#15), Quantified Self (#12), Decision journals (#17), SDT (#9)

Measure what you control (actions taken, effort invested, skills practiced) not just outcomes (results obtained). Inputs are leading indicators. Outputs are lagging and contaminated by luck.

### Principle 6: Questions, Not Instructions
**Sources:** Coaching models (#11), Self-coaching research (#11), SDT (#9), Journaling research (#20)

Questions activate search/exploration mode. Instructions activate compliance mode. Use "What" and "How" stems. Avoid "Why" (triggers defensiveness) except for values exploration. Keep questions short and singular.

### Principle 7: Two Cadences: Daily Capture + Weekly Synthesis
**Sources:** Every domain converges on this. Neuroscience (#6), CBT/DBT (#5), Org learning (#15), GTD (#3), Sports science (#4)

Daily = data collection (ratings, quick capture, 2-5 min). Weekly = pattern recognition, insight generation, strategic adjustment (15-20 min). The daily keeps you honest; the weekly reveals patterns. Neurologically: two spaced retrieval events optimize memory consolidation.

### Principle 8: Tiny Start, Gradual Graduation
**Sources:** Habit design (#18), Fogg's Tiny Habits, Sports periodization (#4)

Start with one tap. Graduate to more only after demonstrating consistency. Never increase difficulty and frequency simultaneously. The review habit matters more than the review content.

### Principle 9: Data Anchors Memory
**Sources:** Behavioral economics (#7), Neuroscience (#6), Quantified Self (#12)

Daily tracking data corrects the remembering self's distortions (peak-end rule, negativity bias, duration neglect). Start weekly reviews with data, not feeling -- the data anchors the review in reality.

### Principle 10: The Blocker Question Is Highest Value
**Sources:** Org learning (#15 -- Toyota Kata, Agile standups), Coaching (#11 -- GROW Reality stage), CBT (#5)

"What's in your way?" surfaces what you're avoiding. Consistently the most valuable question across organizational and personal review systems. A system that forces you to name what you're avoiding is transformative.

### Principle 11: Flexible Accountability Over Rigid Tracking
**Sources:** Habit design (#18 -- streak psychology), SDT (#9 -- autonomy), Quantified Self (#12 -- tracking burnout), Sports science (#4 -- deload weeks)

Use flexible streaks (5/7 weekly), streak freezes, partial credit. Avoid all-or-nothing tracking that triggers the abstinence violation effect. Build in rest/deload weeks. The system should feel like support, not surveillance.

### Principle 12: Narrative + Numbers, Not Either/Or
**Sources:** Org learning (#15 -- Amazon), Narrative psychology (#8), Quantified Self (#12), Coaching (#11)

The most effective reviews combine quantitative scores with qualitative context. Numbers alone lack meaning. Narratives alone lack precision. Together, they produce the richest insights.

### Principle 13: End on Forward-Looking Positive
**Sources:** Behavioral economics (#7 -- peak-end rule), Time Perspective (#16), Circadian (#14 -- fresh start effect)

The ending of a review disproportionately colors how the entire review is remembered. Always close with a forward-looking, positive, agency-oriented prompt. This leverages peak-end rule and primes the fresh start effect for the next period.

### Principle 14: State Before Content
**Sources:** Polyvagal theory (#22), Contemplative practices (#13), CFT (#24)

Before presenting review prompts, assess the user's nervous system state. A dysregulated user cannot meaningfully engage with structured reflection. Adapt review depth and type to current state: ventral vagal = full review appropriate, sympathetic = quick capture only, dorsal vagal = grounding first, possibly skip review entirely.

### Principle 15: Defusion Over Dispute
**Sources:** ACT (#21), CBT (#5), Inner Game (#11)

When dealing with negative self-talk and unhelpful thoughts, defusion (seeing thoughts as thoughts) is often more sustainable than disputation (challenging whether thoughts are true). "I'm having the thought that I'm not good enough" creates distance without requiring the thought to be proven false — useful when the thought is partially true.

### Principle 16: Values Over Goals
**Sources:** ACT (#21), SDT (#9), Identity-Based Motivation (#26)

Values are ongoing directions; goals are achievable endpoints. Values cannot be "completed" or "failed," making them more sustainable as review anchors. "Did I move toward my value of courage?" is more resilient than "Did I hit 10 approaches?" Include values tracking alongside goal tracking.

### Principle 17: Match User's Stage
**Sources:** Stages of Change (#25), Personalization (S2), Longitudinal Evolution (S4)

Users at different stages of change and different experience levels need fundamentally different review prompts. Early-stage users need exploration and validation; action-stage users need troubleshooting and reinforcement; maintenance-stage users need relapse prevention and integration. Detect or assess stage and adapt accordingly.

### Principle 18: Oscillation Is Healthy
**Sources:** Dual-Process Coping (#19 enhancement), CFT (#24), Contraindications (S3)

Healthy processing oscillates between sitting-with-difficulty (loss-oriented) and moving-forward (restoration-oriented). Don't always push toward growth and extraction — sometimes pure emotional processing IS the correct review. Detect which mode the user needs and honor it.

### Principle 19: Expand Emotional Vocabulary Gradually
**Sources:** Emotional Granularity (#23), Contemplative practices (#13)

Higher emotional granularity (fine distinctions between similar emotions) predicts better emotional regulation. The review system should progressively introduce more nuanced emotional vocabulary over time, teaching users to distinguish "disappointed" from "dejected" from "frustrated" as a therapeutic intervention.

### Principle 20: Include Safe Exits
**Sources:** Contraindications (S3), SDT (#9), Polyvagal (#22)

Every review must have an easy, guilt-free exit. "Not today" should always be visible and acceptable. Forced reflection can cause harm in certain states. The system should detect when reviews are being abandoned or generating resistance, and offer to simplify, pause, or explore what's happening.

## Master Daily Review Framework

**Target:** 2-5 minutes, evening (1-2 hours before bed), graduated entry

### Minimum Viable (Level 1): 10 seconds
- One-tap day rating (1-5)

### Standard (Level 3): 2-3 minutes
1. **Day rating** (1-5 tap) -- quick emotional pulse
2. **One good thing** -- "What's one moment you're glad happened?" (past-positive activation)
3. **One observation** -- "What did you notice about yourself today?" (non-judgmental)
4. **One-sentence capture** -- Optional free text for anything that needs recording

### Extended (Level 5): 5-10 minutes
Add to Standard:
5. **Energy/state rating** (1-5) -- tracking recovery-stress balance
6. **Challenge level** -- "Was today's challenge about right, too easy, or too hard?" (flow tracking)
7. **Inner critic check** -- "What was your inner critic saying today?" (Self 1 identification)
8. **Tomorrow's focus** -- "What one thing do you want to pay attention to tomorrow?" (intention, not goal)

### Design Notes:
- Always start with rating (quick win, anchors the review)
- Use past-positive prompt before any challenge-related prompts
- Body-based "How do you feel physically?" can precede cognitive prompts
- Evening timing leverages hippocampal consolidation during sleep
- Provide "Same as yesterday" shortcut for routine days
- Celebrate completion at every level

---

## Master Weekly Review Framework

**Target:** 15-20 minutes, Monday morning (fresh start effect + analytical peak) or Sunday evening

### Phase 1: Ground (2 min)
*Purpose: anchor in data, activate observation mode*
- Review this week's daily data (auto-generated dashboard: days active, ratings trend, volume)
- Quick body check: "How are you feeling right now, before we start?"

### Phase 2: Appreciate (3 min)
*Purpose: activate past-positive, counter negativity bias*
- "What's one moment from this week you're most glad happened?"
- "What strength did you use this week?" (character strengths spotting)
- "What's one thing that went better than expected?"

### Phase 3: Examine (5 min)
*Purpose: pattern recognition, honest assessment*
- **Scaling:** "On a scale of 1-10, where are you with [focus area]?" -> "What's keeping you from being lower?" -> "What would one point higher look like?"
- **Blockers:** "What's in your way right now? What are you avoiding?"
- **Input check:** "Did I do the actions I committed to?" (input metrics vs. plan)
- **Decision quality:** "Which outcomes this week were earned vs. lucky?" (anti-resulting)

### Phase 4: Process (3 min)
*Purpose: emotional processing, meaning-making*
- "What challenged you this week, and what did it teach you?" (past-as-learning)
- For difficult moments: "How are you feeling about [X] now, with some distance?"
- "Is there anything useful you're taking from this? (It's okay if not yet.)" (optional benefit finding)

### Phase 5: Orient (3 min)
*Purpose: future intention, agency, commitment*
- "What's one thing you want to focus on next week?" (GROW: Options -> Will)
- "What small experiment would you like to try?" (Toyota Kata)
- Commitment check: "1-10, how committed are you to this?" (if <8, revise)
- "What are you looking forward to *enjoying* next week?" (present-hedonistic, forward-looking close)

### Phase 6: Close (1 min)
- One-sentence summary: "This week in one sentence..."
- Review complete. Celebrate.

### Design Notes:
- GROW structure underlies the flow: Goal check (Phase 1 data), Reality (Phase 3), Options (Phase 5), Will (Phase 5 commitment)
- SFBT scaling is embedded in Phase 3
- Temporal sandwich: present grounding -> past-positive -> past-as-learning -> future intention -> present return
- The seven meaning-making steps are embedded: Acknowledge (Phase 4) -> Feel -> Examine (Phase 3) -> Connect (Phase 2) -> Extract (Phase 4) -> Grow -> Orient (Phase 5)
- Rotate some prompts weekly to prevent staleness; keep scaling and commitment as anchors

## Template Structures

**Note on Template Evolution:** Templates should adapt based on user archetype (S2), current state (S3), and longitudinal phase (S4). The templates below are starting points that the system adapts dynamically.

### Template 0: State-Gated Entry (REQUIRED PREAMBLE)

- Ethical reflection: "How did your actions affect others this week?"
- Identity flexibility: "Who are you beyond your achievements?"
- Watch for: post-achievement depression signals, compulsive goal escalation, purposelessness language

- ONE gentle prompt (rotating):
  - "What do you need right now?"
  - "Who feels safe?"
  - "What sensation do you notice?"
- Explicit "enough" marker
- Option to skip entirely with no guilt

### Template Adaptation Rules

1. **State gates content**: Always run Template 0 preamble. Dysregulated users never see Templates 3+.
2. **Phase unlocks depth**: Templates 5b and 6's identity content only available after month 6 by default.
3. **Archetype adjusts tone**: High-neuroticism users see more soothing, fewer evaluative prompts. Low-conscientiousness users see lower friction, more flexible completion criteria.
4. **Stage of change adjusts motivation**: Contemplation-stage users see exploratory prompts; action-stage users see troubleshooting prompts.
5. **Never force full templates**: Users can always complete at any level. Any engagement counts.
6. **Attachment style selects heartbreak protocol**: During rejection/heartbreak processing, route based on attachment style (anxious → guard rumination; avoidant → invite feeling; disorganized → high support + crisis access).
7. **Neurodivergence selects adapted templates**: ADHD users → Template 9 (short, variable, momentum-based). Autism users → Template 10 (structured, sensation-based, pattern-focused). Combined → Template 12 for heartbreak scenarios.
8. **Success phase triggers different prompts**: Users achieving consistent results → Template 11, with arrival fallacy and ethical reflection content.
9. **Clinical signals route to Template 7 + resources**: Any detection of sustained hopelessness, crisis language, or functional impairment → Template 7 with crisis resources prominently displayed.
10. **RSD requires validation before reframe**: For users with ADHD experiencing rejection, always validate emotional intensity ("That sounds really painful") before any cognitive work.
11. **Grief phase adapts heartbreak protocol**: Loss-orientation → soothing, no analysis; restoration-orientation → gentle forward-looking prompts.
12. **Alexithymia bypasses emotion words**: Users who can't access emotions → sensation-based or pattern-based prompts, never force emotional labeling.
13. **Motivation type selects prompt framing**: Achievement-motivated → metrics/skills focus; affiliation-motivated → connection/belonging focus; power-motivated → impact/influence focus.
14. **Approach/avoidance matches user orientation**: Default to approach framing ("What did you move toward?"), but meet avoidance-oriented users where they are before gradually shifting.
15. **Mastery reframe after setbacks**: For performance-oriented users experiencing failure, explicitly reframe toward mastery ("What did this teach you?") to prevent dropout.
16. **Obsessive passion detection triggers balance prompts**: If user shows compulsion indicators (guilt about breaks, rigid engagement), prompt for flexibility and alternative activities.
17. **Self-concordance check in goal-setting**: Monthly prompts to verify goals are authentically chosen ("Would you continue if no one watched?") — non-concordant goals don't satisfy even when achieved.

## Timing Recommendations

| Review Type | Optimal Timing | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Daily review | Evening, 7-9 PM (adjust for chronotype) | Memory consolidation before sleep, past afternoon trough, emotional distance from events |
| Morning intention | 30-60 min after waking | Cortisol awakening response, fresh start, analytical peak approaching |
| Weekly review | Monday morning (primary) or Sunday evening (alternative) | Monday = strongest fresh start effect; morning = analytical peak for pattern recognition |
| Monthly review | 1st of month (morning) | Temporal landmark, fresh start effect |
| NEVER prompt | 1:00-3:00 PM | Afternoon trough: lowest alertness, highest error rates, worst time for reflection |

**Methodology note:** All 31 research domains (20 original + 6 from v2.0 + 4 from v3.0 + 1 from v4.0) were investigated using AI training knowledge (web search was unavailable during research). All cited studies are real and well-known in their fields. Exact statistics (effect sizes, sample sizes) should be verified against original papers before use in production. Directional findings and relative magnitudes are reliable.

**Cultural humility note:** The research base underlying this document reflects significant biases that users and implementers should be aware of:

- **WEIRD bias**: Most psychological research uses Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic samples. Findings may not generalize to non-WEIRD populations.
- **Individualist framing**: Self-improvement frameworks in this document assume an individualist cultural orientation. Collectivist cultures (common in East Asia, Latin America, Africa, and indigenous communities worldwide) may conceptualize growth differently — through harmony with others and community contribution rather than individual optimization.
- **Emotion vocabularies differ**: English emotion words don't map directly to other languages. Some cultures have emotions English lacks (Japanese *amae*, Portuguese *saudade*, German *Schadenfreude*). Emotion prompts may not translate cleanly.
- **Expression norms vary**: What counts as "healthy emotional expression" varies culturally. Some cultures value emotional restraint; others value expressive display. Neither is pathological.
- **Honor/shame cultures**: Process rejection and failure differently than guilt-based cultures. Public vs. private failure carries different weight. Face and family honor are factors.
- **Religious/spiritual frameworks**: Many cultures integrate self-improvement with religious or spiritual practice. Secular framing may feel incomplete or inappropriate.

This research reflects its sources. Implementers should adapt frameworks for cultural context rather than assuming universal applicability. When working with diverse populations, seek input from members of those communities rather than applying Western frameworks unmodified.
