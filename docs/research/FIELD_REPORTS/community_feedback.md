## What Users Say Works

### The 80/20 Approach
Source: [Skilled Seducer](https://www.skilledseducer.com/threads/stickied-how-to-write-efficient-field-reports-80-20-rule-time-hack.18988/)

User: "Started writing down my interactions in great detail to analyze why they failed... way more improvement than the last few hundred approaches."

**Key Insight:** "Writing field reports can take ages. Focusing on the emotional tipping points saves time."

### Three Main Benefits Users Report

1. **Documents Progress** - "You can use it for future reference"
2. **Creates Accountability** - "You have to do it and write the results"
3. **Provides Feedback** - "Can help correct sticking points"

## What Users Say DOESN'T Work

### Stats Become Counterproductive
Source: [Thomas Crown PUA](https://thomascrownpua.com/2019/09/28/how-to-keep-daygame-statistics/)

**After 1000 approaches:**
- "You become anchored to them"
- "You may start going for easier sets"
- "Daygame is supposed to be fun"

**Recommended Progression:**
| Year | What to Track |
|------|---------------|
| 1-3 | Sets, phone numbers, dates, lays |
| 4 | Stop recording phone number ratios |
| 5 | Stop tracking date counts |
| 6+ | Only remember lay count |

### Over-Detailed Reports
"You can reach a point where you're spending much time writing without a huge return on investment."

### Reports Without Feedback
Some users post but don't engage with feedback. The real value comes from external perspective.

## Community Debates

### Report Timing
| Timing | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Immediately | Fresh memory | May still be emotional |
| Same night | Time to decompress | Details may fade |
| Next morning | Fresh perspective | Lose specifics |

**Consensus:** Write basic notes immediately, deeper analysis within 24 hours.

### Report Length
"Although more detail is generally better, you can write a short field report in about five minutes and get a lot of insights."

**Julien Blanc quote:** "Game is 49% taking action and 51% writing field reports."

## What Users Ask For Help With

Common questions:
- "What would you have done differently?"
- "Where did I lose her?"
- "Should I have more structure?"

**Users want specific, actionable criticism**, not vague encouragement.

---

## User Frustrations

### Low Quality Reports
The community's golden rule: "Does this post help someone get laid?"

**Great reports focus on:**
- Techniques/mindsets specifically used
- What changed the interaction
- What would have turned failure to success

**Bad reports:**
- Just narrative without analysis
- "I approached, we talked, she left"
- Bragging without teaching

### Forums Become Echo Chambers
Critics note: "The seduction community is run through with feel-good 'positive thinking'... guys keep coming back instead of solving problems."

## Audio/Voice Recording

### Voice Memos
Source: [One Man's Life Mission](https://onemanslifemission.com/how-to-write-a-pick-up-field-report-pua-field-report/)

"Record audio voice memos at end of each approach while fresh."

**Benefits:**
- Captures emotional state
- Faster than typing
- Can be transcribed later
- Preserves details

**Drawback:** Harder to search/review.

## Design Implications

|---------|-------------|
| Quick capture needed | Voice memo + simple quick log |
| Stats counterproductive after ~1000 | Phase out detailed tracking |
| Users want specific feedback | AI gives direct, specific guidance |
| Detail fatigue is real | 80/20 templates, focus on key moments |
| Community accountability works | Streak tracking, social features |
| Forums echo chamber risk | Ground feedback in evidence |
