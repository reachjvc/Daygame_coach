| Finding | Source | Application |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Habit formation takes 59-66 days median | Multiple studies | Set expectations |
| Consistency > Intensity | Journal of Applied Psychology | Short daily > sporadic long |
| Habit stacking +64% success | 2025 JAP study | Link to existing routine |
| Morning routines 43% more successful | Habit research | Consider morning reflection |
| Tracking increases success by 40% | APA research | Show streak metrics |
| Identity-based habits +32% adherence | JPSP study | "I am" not "I should" |
| Environmental cues +58% adherence | 2018 review | Notifications, dedicated location |

## The Habit Loop

1. **Cue** → Trigger (time, location, emotional state, preceding action)
2. **Routine** → The behavior (completing field report)
3. **Reward** → Satisfaction (insight gained, streak maintained, XP earned)

**Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt converge at the same moment.**

**Types of Prompts:**
| Prompt Type | When to Use | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Spark | Low motivation, high ability | Inspiring quote, reminder of why |
| Facilitator | High motivation, low ability | Simplified template, voice input |
| Signal | Both high | Simple reminder notification |

## Implementation Intentions
Sources: [Gollwitzer](https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/goal_intent_attain.pdf), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention)

**Format:** "If [situation X], then I will [behavior Y]"

**Meta-Analysis (94 studies, 8,000+ participants):** Medium-to-large effect size (d=0.65) on goal attainment.

**Key Finding:** Difficult goals completed 3x more often with implementation intentions.

**Examples:**
```yaml
implementation_intentions:
  reflection:
    situation: "When I get home from a session"
    action: "I will immediately open the app and log my best moment"
```

## Tiny Habits Approach

- Start with smallest possible version ("write one sentence")
- Celebrate immediately after completing the behavior
- Scale up only after habit is established

---

## Friction Reduction Strategies

- One sentence minimum (lowering the bar)
- Pre-filled defaults
- Voice-to-text option
- Templates reduce decision fatigue

---

## Design Implications

- Gamification (XP, streaks) directly maps to habit formation
- Quick Log template enables consistency
- Offer "one sentence" minimum for field reports
- Celebrate completion immediately (confetti, XP, streak update)
- Frame around identity: "I am someone who reflects on experiences"
- Suggest habit stacking: "After I [existing habit], I will complete my field report"
