## Self-Compassion (Kristin Neff)
Sources: [Self-Compassion.org](https://self-compassion.org/the-research/), [Annual Review of Psychology 2023](https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Neff-2023.pdf)

**Three Components:**
| Component | Description | Opposite |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Self-kindness | Treat yourself as a friend | Self-judgment |
| Common humanity | Struggle is universal | Isolation ("only I fail") |
| Mindfulness | Balanced awareness | Over-identification |

**Research Findings:**
- Greater resilience than self-esteem
- Positive association with mastery goals
- Greater self-efficacy (medium effect size)
- Less rumination and fear of failure
- Motivation NOT undermined by self-compassion

**The Self-Compassion Break:**
1. "This is a moment of difficulty" (mindfulness)
2. "Struggle is part of learning" (common humanity)
3. "May I be kind to myself" (self-kindness)

**Key Question:** "What would you tell a friend in this situation?"

## Growth Mindset (Carol Dweck)
Sources: [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/), [Education Week](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset/2015/09)

| Fixed Mindset | Growth Mindset |
|---------------|----------------|
| "I'm not good at this" | "I'm not good at this YET" |
| Avoids challenges | Embraces challenges |
| Sees effort as fruitless | Sees effort as path to mastery |
| Ignores criticism | Learns from criticism |
| Threatened by others' success | Inspired by others' success |

**The Power of "Yet":** Adding "yet" to negative statements increases persistence.

**Critical Clarification:** Growth mindset is NOT just about effort. Must link to effective strategies.

**Four Sources of Self-Efficacy:**
| Source | How to Apply |

| Mastery Experiences | Highlight and celebrate wins |
| Vicarious Experiences | Share community success stories |
| Social Persuasion | AI coach encouragement, wing support |
| Physiological States | Track energy, mood, anxiety levels |

**Key Insight:** "Successfully navigating setbacks can lead to even stronger self-belief than never facing difficulty at all."

## Feedback Intervention Theory (Kluger & DeNisi)
Sources: [Meta-analysis](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-02773-003)

**Landmark Finding (607 studies):**
- 1/3 of the time: Feedback improves performance
- 1/3 of the time: Feedback does nothing
- 1/3 of the time: Feedback DECREASES performance

**When Feedback Harms:**
- Attention shifts to self/ego instead of task
- Complex, unfamiliar tasks with high cognitive load
- Recipient already anxious
- Feedback threatens self-image

**When Feedback Helps:**
- Combined with goal-setting
- Focuses on task, not person
- Simple, familiar tasks
- Recipient has high self-efficacy
- Includes strategies, not just outcome

## Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham)
Sources: [Positive Psychology](https://positivepsychology.com/goal-setting-theory/), [MindTools](https://www.mindtools.com/azazlu3/lockes-goal-setting-theory/)

**35 Years of Research:**
- Specific, challenging goals led to higher performance 90% of the time
- Difficult goals = 250% higher performance than easy goals

**Learning Goals vs. Performance Goals:**
- For NEW, COMPLEX tasks: Learning goals work better
- "Focus on learning" beats "focus on outcome" for skill acquisition

## Psychological Safety (Edmondson)
Sources: [Edmondson 1999](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2307/2666999), [HBS](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=2959)

**Discovery:** Higher-performing teams reported MORE errors. Psychological safety enabled honest reporting, which enabled learning.

**Google's Project Aristotle:** Psychological safety was the #1 factor behind high-performing teams.

**Application:** Users need psychological safety with THEMSELVES to honestly assess performance.

## Design Implications

- "Blowout Recovery" includes "What would you tell a friend?"
- Add common humanity element: "Every skilled person failed many times learning"
- Use "yet" language in all prompts and feedback
- Praise process and strategy, not inherent ability
- Emphasize mastery experiences in UI (wins wall, success log)
- Always pair feedback with actionable strategies
- Keep focus on task and process, not user identity
- Be cautious with feedback for anxious/struggling users
- Frame work as learning problem, not execution problem
