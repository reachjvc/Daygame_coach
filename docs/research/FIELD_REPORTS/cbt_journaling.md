**Core Concept:** Written exercise to identify automatic thoughts, connected emotions, and consequent behavior in stressful situations.

## Benefits for Skill Development

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Self-awareness | Writing surfaces thought-feeling-behavior connections |
| Emotional processing | Safe private expression aids processing |
| Emotional regulation | Understanding origins allows choosing response |
| Pattern recognition | Repeated logging reveals cognitive distortions |

## The Thought Diary Structure

1. Situation - What happened? (factual)
2. Automatic thoughts - What went through your mind?
3. Emotions - What did you feel? (rate intensity 0-100)
4. Evidence for - What supports this thought?
5. Evidence against - What contradicts this thought?
6. Balanced thought - More realistic perspective
7. Outcome - How do you feel now?

## Cognitive Distortions to Watch

| Distortion | Example in Context |
|------------|-------------------|
| All-or-nothing | "The set was a complete failure" |
| Catastrophizing | "I'll never be good at this" |
| Mind reading | "She definitely thought I was weird" |
| Overgeneralization | "Women always reject me" |
| Discounting positives | "That doesn't count, just luck" |

## Emotion Regulation Science

**Two Key Strategies:**

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Cognitive Reappraisal | When you can change perspective |
| Acceptance | When situation can't be changed |

**Reappraisal Tactics:**
1. **Reinterpretation:** "This rejection is useful data"
2. **Distancing:** "How will I view this in 5 years?"

## Reflection vs. Rumination
Sources: [Child Focus](https://www.child-focus.org/news/what-is-the-difference-between-self-reflection-and-rumination-constructive-vs-destructive-thoughts/), [MSU Extension](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/reflection_or_rumination)

| Reflection | Rumination |
|------------|------------|
| Purposeful processing | Repetitive without purpose |
| Goal of learning/insight | Stuck in replay |
| Active, moves forward | Passive, goes in circles |
| Constructive | Self-flagellating |
| Time-limited | Endless |

**Shift from Rumination to Reflection:**
- Replace abstract "why" with concrete "how"
- Set time limits on processing
- Label the experience ("I notice I'm ruminating")
- Focus on actionable next steps

## Design Implications

- "Blowout Recovery" template already uses CBT principles
- Add cognitive distortion identification for emotional processing
- Offer both reappraisal AND acceptance pathways
- Build rumination detection into AI analysis
- Always end with action-oriented prompt to break loops
