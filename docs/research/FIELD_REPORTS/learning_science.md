## Deliberate Practice Theory
Sources: [Ericsson et al. 1993](https://www.academia.edu/16624318/The_role_of_deliberate_practice_in_the_acquisition_of_expert_performance), [PMC Review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7461852/), [Structural Learning](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/deliberate-practice)

**Definition (Ericsson):** "When individuals engage in practice activities with full concentration on improving some specific aspect of performance."

**Core Components:**
| Component | Description | Field Report Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Specific goal | Focus on particular skill | "Technique practiced" field |
| Full concentration | Engaged, not mindless | Prompts that require thought |
| Immediate feedback | Know results quickly | Same-day reporting |
| Problem-solving time | Analyze what went wrong | "Why it ended" analysis |
| Repetition | Practice the skill again | "What to try next time" |

## Skill Acquisition Stages (Fitts 1964)
Sources: [Sport Science Insider](https://sportscienceinsider.com/stages-of-learning/), [Human Kinetics](https://us.humankinetics.com/blogs/excerpt/understanding-motor-learning-stages-improves-skill-instruction)

| Stage | Characteristics | Template Implication |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Cognitive | High mental effort, many errors, inconsistent | Detailed templates with guidance |
| Associative | Fewer errors, more consistent, refining | Standard debrief, some autonomy |
| Autonomous | Automatic, effortless, minimal thought | Quick logs, focus on edge cases only |

**Key Shift:** "Initial, explicit control gives way to more routinized forms of control."

## Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle
Sources: [Simply Psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html), [Norwich University](https://online.norwich.edu/online/about/resource-library/4-components-experiential-learning-cycle)

```
1. CONCRETE EXPERIENCE  →  2. REFLECTIVE OBSERVATION
        (Do it)                 (Think about it)
           ↑                           ↓
4. ACTIVE EXPERIMENTATION ←  3. ABSTRACT CONCEPTUALIZATION
      (Try new approach)          (Draw conclusions)
```

**Stage Mapping to Field Reports:**
| Kolb Stage | Field Report Element |
|------------|---------------------|
| Concrete Experience | (precedes report) |
| Reflective Observation | Debrief sections |
| Abstract Conceptualization | Key insight, why it ended |
| Active Experimentation | Forward action, technique to practice |

**Key Insight:** Learning requires completing the full cycle. A report that only documents without extracting lessons and planning change is incomplete.

## Spaced Repetition & Retrieval Practice
Sources: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), [MedStudy](https://explore.medstudy.com/blog/how-spaced-retrieval-works), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8759977/)

**The Spacing Effect (Ebbinghaus, 1885):** Repetitions spaced in time produce stronger memories than massed together.

**Key Statistics:**
- Spaced repetition increases long-term retention by 200-300% vs. cramming
- Students retain 80-90% after six months vs. 20-30% with cramming

**Application:**
| Learning Principle | Field Report Application |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Spaced repetition | Review past reports periodically |
| Retrieval practice | Answer questions from memory first |
| Interleaving | Mix different challenges |

## Metacognition & Self-Regulation
Sources: [EEF](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/education-evidence/teaching-learning-toolkit/metacognition-and-self-regulation), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8734377/)

**Definition:** "Cognition about cognition" - awareness and control of one's own thinking processes.

**Two Components:**
1. **Metacognitive Knowledge** - Knowing about yourself as a learner
2. **Metacognitive Regulation** - Planning, Monitoring, Evaluating

**Key Finding:** Metacognitive approaches improve outcomes across domains.

## Design Implications

- Template recommendations should adapt to user skill level
- Every template needs at least one element from Kolb stages 3 and 4
- Periodically surface old reports for review (spaced repetition)
- Consider retrieval prompts: "What did you learn last session?" before new report
- Track quality of session, not just quantity
- Explicitly teach reflection strategies, don't assume users know how
- Include monitoring prompts: "How confident are you in this assessment?"
