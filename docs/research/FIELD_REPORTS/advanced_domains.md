## Poker & Trading: Decision Journals
Sources: [Jared Tendler](https://jaredtendler.com/), [FX Replay](https://www.fxreplay.com/learn/trading-psychology-starts-with-a-journal--heres-why)

**Core Insight:** "Emotions are signals, not obstacles. Fear, greed, tilt, or frustration point to deeper flaws."

**Journal Framework:**
1. Pre-session mindset
2. Session log (decisions, not just outcomes)
3. Post-session review (patterns in decision quality)
4. Emotional pattern tracking

**Critical Distinction:** Focus on decision quality, not outcome. Good decisions can have bad outcomes (variance).

**Tilt Indicators:**
- Frustration beyond normal
- Changing approach out of panic
- Overconfidence after early success
- Going through motions without effort

**Design Implication:** Add pre-session mindset check, emphasize decision quality over outcomes.

Sources: [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective), [GoRetro](https://www.goretro.ai/post/how-to-run-a-blameless-sprint-retrospective)

**Blameless Culture:**
- Focus on WHAT happened, not WHO caused it
- Replace "you should have" with "I felt" or "I noticed"
- Goal is learning, not punishment

**Popular Formats:**
| Format | Structure |
|--------|-----------|
| Start-Stop-Continue | What to start, stop, continue |
| 4 Ls | Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for |
| Mad-Sad-Glad | Emotional categorization |

**Design Implication:** Frame all prompts as blameless self-analysis.

**Best Practices:**
