Developed by US Army in 1970s. Called "one of the most successful organizational learning methods yet devised."

## The Four Core Questions

1. **What did we intend to accomplish?** (goal/strategy)
2. **What actually happened?** (execution)
3. **Why did it happen that way?** (gap analysis)
4. **What will we do differently next time?** (adaptation)

**Key Distinction:** AAR begins with comparing intended vs. actual results. Learning is carried forward by participants, not just the leader.

## Critical Success Factors

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Timing | Immediate feedback = more accurate recall |
| Safe environment | Candor requires psychological safety |
| Focus on WHAT not WHO | No blame, analyze performance |
| Equality assumption | Rank doesn't matter during AAR |
| Self-discovery | Use leading questions, don't lecture |

## Common Failure Mode

Peter Senge notes AARs often fail when "reduced to a sterile technique." Must be "more verb than noun" - a living process.

---

## Organizational Techniques

- Chronological order (follow event flow)
- Key themes/issues (organize by topic)
- Warfighting functions (organize by capability area)

---

## Design Implications

- Add "What was your goal?" before "What happened?"
- The "Why did it end?" question maps directly to AAR question #3
- Frame analysis as self-examination, not external judgment
- Consider explicit intended vs. actual comparison for advanced users
