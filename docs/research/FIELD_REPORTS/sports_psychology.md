## The "Well, Better, How" Method
Source: [Brian Cain Peak Performance](https://briancain.com/blog/performance-journaling.html)

After each session, write:
1. **What did I do well?**
2. **What can I do better?**
3. **How am I going to get better?**

*"Writing down your well, better, how notes post-training helps you to let the game go."*

- **3 Highlights** - what stood out positively
- **2 Lowlights** - areas for improvement
- **1 Forward** - lesson to take with you

## Post-Game Debrief Questions
Sources: [Sport Resilience](https://sportresilience.com/debrief-questions/), [BelievePerform](https://members.believeperform.com/debriefing-in-sport/)

**Emotional Processing:**
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "Why did it make you feel that way?"

**Learning-Focused:**
- "What did you learn from this?"
- "What can you learn for next time?"
- "What one thing will you take as a key learning?"

**Improvement-Focused:**
- "What didn't go so well?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"
- "What other ways could you have overcome this?"

## Key Research Findings

1. **Timing matters**: Shorter, sharper debriefs work better. Consider emotional state - sometimes wait until next day.

2. **Positive framing impacts future performance**: Players who received positive feedback had better performance AND higher pre-game testosterone in subsequent games. ([Science of Running](https://www.scienceofrunning.com/2017/03/what-you-say-matters-how-the-post-race-debrief-influences-performance.html))

3. **Reflection is where growth happens**: "Reflection is where you get to extract the DNA from that performance and improve your preparation moving forward."

4. **Deliberate practice correlation**: Research shows deliberate practice accounts for ~18% of variance in sports performance - significant but not everything. ([Ericsson research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27217246/))

## Design Implications

- Use "Well, Better, How" as standard debrief structure
- Always include positive element before critique
- Keep debriefs short and focused
- Time reflection appropriately (consider emotional state)
