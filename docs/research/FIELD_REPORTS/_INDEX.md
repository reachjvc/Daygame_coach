## For AI: How to Use This Research

**DO NOT READ ALL FILES BY DEFAULT.** This folder contains ~1,600 lines of supporting research. Only load what you need.

### Quick Start (Most Tasks)
Read only: `DESIGN.md` (~250 lines)
- Contains all actionable principles, templates, and design implications
- Sufficient for most article writing, template design, and feature work

### When to Load Additional Research
| Task | Files to Load |
|------|---------------|
| Writing about sports psychology | `research/sports_psychology.md` |
| Writing about military/AAR methodology | `research/military_aar.md` |
| Writing about CBT/emotional processing | `research/cbt_journaling.md` |
| Writing about habits/behavior design | `research/habit_science.md` |
| Writing about learning/deliberate practice | `research/learning_science.md` |
| Discussing user feedback/community preferences | `research/community_feedback.md` |
| Citing specific research | `research/sources.md` |

## Research Summary

This research covers **25 design principles** derived from:
- Daygame community best practices
- Sports psychology (debriefing, performance)
- Military organizational learning (AAR)
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Habit formation science
- Learning science and deliberate practice
- Self-compassion and growth mindset research
- User community feedback

**Key insight:** The research consistently shows that:
1. Less friction = more consistency
2. Emotional processing should precede tactical analysis
3. Balance positive and negative (wins matter for hormones)
4. The critical question: "Why did it end?"
5. Always end with forward action, not just reflection
