# Videos permanently excluded from the pipeline.
# Format: <video_id> | <source_name> | <reason> | <date>
#
# Adding a video here will:
#   1. Inject it into the source's yt-dlp archive file (prevents re-download)
#   2. Exclude it from download-missing-audio.sh gap detection
#   3. Provide an audit trail of why it was excluded
#
# To exclude a new video:
#   1. Add a line below
#   2. Run: ./scripts/training-data/sync-exclusions
#      (or it runs automatically at the start of final_pipeline)
